The Highland Widow’s Lament
     Oh I am come to the low Countrie,
     Ochon, Ochon, Ochrie!
     Without a penny in my purse,
     To buy a meal to me.
     It was na sae in the Highland hills,
     Ochon, Ochon, Ochrie!
     Nae woman in the Country wide,
     Sae happy was as me.
     For then I had a score o’kye,
     Ochon, Ochon, Ochrie!
     Feeding on you hill sae high,
     And giving milk to me.
     And there I had three score o’yowes,
     Ochon, Ochon, Ochrie!
     Skipping on yon bonie knowes,
     And casting woo’ to me.
     I was the happiest of a’ the Clan,
     Sair, sair, may I repine;
     For Donald was the brawest man,
     And Donald he was mine.
     Till Charlie Stewart cam at last,
     Sae far to set us free;
     My Donald’s arm was wanted then,
     For Scotland and for me.
     Their waefu’ fate what need I tell,
     Right to the wrang did yield;
     My Donald and his Country fell,
     Upon Culloden field.
     Oh I am come to the low Countrie,
     Ochon, Ochon, Ochrie!
     Nae woman in the warld wide,
     Sae wretched now as me.
