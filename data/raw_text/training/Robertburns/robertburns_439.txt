Stay My Charmer
     Tune—“An gille dubh ciar-dhubh.”
     Stay my charmer, can you leave me?
     Cruel, cruel to deceive me;
     Well you know how much you grieve me;
     Cruel charmer, can you go!
     Cruel charmer, can you go!
     By my love so ill-requited,
     By the faith you fondly plighted,
     By the pangs of lovers slighted,
     Do not, do not liave me so!
     Do not, do not leave me so!
