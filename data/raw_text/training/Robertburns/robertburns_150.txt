The Braes O’ Killiecrankie
     Where hae ye been sae braw, lad?
     Whare hae ye been sae brankie, O?
     Whare hae ye been sae braw, lad?
     Cam ye by Killiecrankie, O?
     Chorus.—An ye had been whare I hae been,
     Ye wad na been sae cantie, O;
     An ye had seen what I hae seen,
     I’ the Braes o’ Killiecrankie, O.
     I faught at land, I faught at sea,
     At hame I faught my Auntie, O;
     But I met the devil an’ Dundee,
     On the Braes o’ Killiecrankie, O.
     An ye had been, &c.
     The bauld Pitcur fell in a furr,
     An’ Clavers gat a clankie, O;
     Or I had fed an Athole gled,
     On the Braes o’ Killiecrankie, O.
     An ye had been, &c.
