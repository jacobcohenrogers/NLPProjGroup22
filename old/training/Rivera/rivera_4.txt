Last summer, I took a solo trip up the coast of California. Just me, a borrowed tent, and a playlist full of songs that made me feel both nostalgic and brave. I remember standing on a cliff in Big Sur, watching the waves crash below, and feeling both small and incredibly alive.

I met strangers who became momentary friends—shared fireside chats and maps drawn on napkins. I wrote poems in the margins of my travel guide. I cried once, in the middle of the redwoods, not out of sadness but out of sheer overwhelm at how beautiful the world can be. That trip didn’t solve any of my problems, but it reminded me that wonder is always waiting, if I’m willing to go looking.
