During my first semester of grad school, I tried to write a paper that I thought would impress my professor. I used elaborate metaphors, cited obscure theorists, and buried my real thoughts under layers of academic fog. When I got it back, there was a single comment: “You’re hiding.”

At first, I was crushed. I’d spent days crafting that piece. But as I reread it, I realized he was right. I wasn’t writing what I believed—I was performing. That moment changed everything. I started writing like I was talking to someone I cared about. I stopped chasing approval and started seeking connection. Failing that paper taught me that clarity and honesty are braver than brilliance.
