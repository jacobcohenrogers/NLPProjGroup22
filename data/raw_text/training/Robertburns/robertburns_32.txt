Duncan Davison
     There was a lass, they ca’d her Meg,
     And she held o’er the moors to spin;
     There was a lad that follow’d her,
     They ca’d him Duncan Davison.
     The moor was dreigh, and Meg was skeigh,
     Her favour Duncan could na win;
     For wi’ the rock she wad him knock,
     And aye she shook the temper-pin.
     As o’er the moor they lightly foor,
     A burn was clear, a glen was green,
     Upon the banks they eas’d their shanks,
     And aye she set the wheel between:
     But Duncan swoor a haly aith,
     That Meg should be a bride the morn;
     Then Meg took up her spinning-graith,
     And flang them a’ out o’er the burn.
     We will big a wee, wee house,
     And we will live like king and queen;
     Sae blythe and merry’s we will be,
     When ye set by the wheel at e’en.
     A man may drink, and no be drunk;
     A man may fight, and no be slain;
     A man may kiss a bonie lass,
     And aye be welcome back again!
