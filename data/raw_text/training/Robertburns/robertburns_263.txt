Extempore In The Court Of Session
     Tune—“Killiercrankie.”
     Lord Advocate
     He clenched his pamphlet in his fist,
     He quoted and he hinted,
     Till, in a declamation-mist,
     His argument he tint it:
     He gaped for’t, he graped for’t,
     He fand it was awa, man;
     But what his common sense came short,
     He eked out wi’ law, man.
     Mr. Erskine
     Collected, Harry stood awee,
     Then open’d out his arm, man;
     [Footnote 1: William Dunbar, W. S., of the Crochallan Fencibles,
      a convivial club.]
     His Lordship sat wi’ ruefu’ e’e,
     And ey’d the gathering storm, man:
     Like wind-driven hail it did assail’
     Or torrents owre a lin, man:
     The Bench sae wise, lift up their eyes,
     Half-wauken’d wi’ the din, man.
