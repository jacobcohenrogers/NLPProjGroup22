Once, Paumanok,
When the snows had melted, and the Fifth-month grass
        was growing,
Up this sea-shore, in some briars,
Two guests from Alabama--two together,
And their nest, and four light-green eggs spotted with brown;
And every day the he-bird, to and fro, near at hand,
And every day the she-bird, crouched on her nest, silent,
        with bright eyes;
And every day I, a curious boy, never too close, never
        disturbing them,
Cautiously peering, absorbing, translating.
