When I was seven, I built a fort in my abuela’s backyard out of beach towels and chairs. I called it my “reading cave” and brought in a flashlight, a notebook, and a half-eaten pack of cookies. The afternoon sun made the orange towel glow like stained glass. I remember the crinkle of pages as I turned them, the hum of bees somewhere nearby, the faint smell of hibiscus.

That little fort was my first sanctuary—a space where stories and dreams mingled freely. I think about it often when I’m overwhelmed. That small act of carving out space for myself taught me something I still carry: even in chaos, you can create a corner of calm. A place to breathe, to imagine, to be.
