Last year, I took a solo train trip down the coast to attend a friend’s wedding. I packed light—just a tote bag, a book, and a laptop I promised not to open. The ride was long, winding through quiet towns and golden fields, and I had no Wi-Fi to distract me. For the first time in ages, I let my thoughts run asynchronously.

Somewhere near Monterey, I watched the sun dip below the Pacific while sipping lukewarm coffee in the dining car. It was a small moment, but it lingered. That trip reminded me that slowing down doesn’t mean falling behind. It’s okay to step out of the loop sometimes—to let things idle, recalibrate, and return with fresh eyes.
