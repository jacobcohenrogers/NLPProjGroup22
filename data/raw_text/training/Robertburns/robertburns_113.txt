Inscription To Miss Graham Of Fintry
     Here, where the Scottish Muse immortal lives,
     In sacred strains and tuneful numbers joined,
     Accept the gift; though humble he who gives,
     Rich is the tribute of the grateful mind.
     So may no ruffian-feeling in my breast,
     Discordant, jar thy bosom-chords among;
     But Peace attune thy gentle soul to rest,
     Or Love, ecstatic, wake his seraph song,
     Or Pityâ€™s notes, in luxury of tears,
     As modest Want the tale of woe reveals;
     While conscious Virtue all the strains endears,
     And heaven-born Piety her sanction seals.
