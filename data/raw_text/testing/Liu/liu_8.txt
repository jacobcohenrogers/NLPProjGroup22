When I was eight, I built a “rocket ship” out of cardboard boxes and duct tape in my backyard. I fully believed I could launch it. My mom even packed me a peanut butter sandwich for the “trip.” I spent hours sitting inside that box, talking into a flashlight like it was mission control. Looking back, that moment wasn’t about the rocket—it was about possibility.

As kids, we let ourselves dream without a filter. Somewhere along the way, we start second-guessing. But that cardboard rocket? It reminds me to hold on to a little wonder, a little belief in the impossible. That energy? It still fuels how I teach, how I learn, how I live.
