I don’t need a mansion or a five-year plan. I just hope for a life with rhythm—a slow, steady beat of curiosity, love, and purpose. I want to wake up in places that surprise me, eat meals that remind me of home, write things that make people feel less alone. I want to keep asking questions, keep sitting on café balconies with a notebook and a half-drunk coffee, watching the world tilt and turn.

And one day, maybe, I’ll settle down near the sea. I’ll have a little garden with too much mint, a crooked bookshelf, and a window that catches the morning light just right. I’ll tell stories to anyone who’ll listen—stories about the world, about people, about the small moments that make a life. And that, I think, would be enough.
