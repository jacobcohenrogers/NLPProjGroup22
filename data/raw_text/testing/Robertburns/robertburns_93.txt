Epigram On Francis Grose The Antiquary
     The Devil got notice that Grose was a-dying
     So whip! at the summons, old Satan came flying;
     But when he approached where poor Francis lay moaning,
     And saw each bed-post with its burthen a-groaning,
     Astonish’d, confounded, cries Satan—“By God,
     I’ll want him, ere I take such a damnable load!”
