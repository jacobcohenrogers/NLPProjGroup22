For The Sake O’ Somebody
     My heart is sair—I dare na tell,
     My heart is sair for Somebody;
     I could wake a winter night
     For the sake o’ Somebody.
     O-hon! for Somebody!
     O-hey! for Somebody!
     I could range the world around,
     For the sake o’ Somebody.
     Ye Powers that smile on virtuous love,
     O, sweetly smile on Somebody!
     Frae ilka danger keep him free,
     And send me safe my Somebody!
     O-hon! for Somebody!
     O-hey! for Somebody!
     I wad do—what wad I not?
     For the sake o’ Somebody.
