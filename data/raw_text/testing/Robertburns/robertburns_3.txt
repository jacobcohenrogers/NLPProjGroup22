The Captain’s Lady
     Chorus.—O mount and go, mount and make you ready,
     O mount and go, and be the Captain’s lady.
     When the drums do beat, and the cannons rattle,
     Thou shalt sit in state, and see thy love in battle:
     When the drums do beat, and the cannons rattle,
     Thou shalt sit in state, and see thy love in battle.
     O mount and go, &c.
     When the vanquish’d foe sues for peace and quiet,
     To the shades we’ll go, and in love enjoy it:
     When the vanquish’d foe sues for peace and quiet,
     To the shades we’ll go, and in love enjoy it.
     O mount and go, &c.
