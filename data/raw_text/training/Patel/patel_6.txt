I love gardening. There’s something immensely grounding about working with plants after a day spent in abstract logic and virtual machines. When I’m tending to my balcony garden, I’m not debugging—I'm nurturing. I measure time not in deadlines, but in new leaves and curling vines.

What draws me in is the quiet, patient feedback loop. You water, you wait. You prune, and you trust. It’s a gentle reminder that not everything can be optimized for speed. Growth—real growth—takes time. And sometimes, the most elegant systems are the ones nature builds, not us.
