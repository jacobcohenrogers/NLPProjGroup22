Down The Burn, Davie
     As down the burn they took their way,
     And thro’ the flowery dale;
     His cheek to hers he aft did lay,
     And love was aye the tale:
     With “Mary, when shall we return,
     Sic pleasure to renew?”
      Quoth Mary—“Love, I like the burn,
     And aye shall follow you.”
