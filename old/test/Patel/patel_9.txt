I hope to keep learning—not just new frameworks or languages, but how to be a better teammate, a better daughter, a better version of myself. In an industry that moves fast and sometimes forgets to breathe, I want to be someone who remembers the human side of the code.

Eventually, I’d love to teach. Maybe part-time, maybe just mentoring—but to pass on what I’ve gathered. Because in the end, knowledge isn’t a trophy; it’s a relay baton. My hope is to keep running my stretch well and then hand it off with care.
