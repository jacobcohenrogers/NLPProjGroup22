The Bard At Inverary
     Whoe’er he be that sojourns here,
     I pity much his case,
     Unless he comes to wait upon
     The Lord their God, His Grace.
     There’s naething here but Highland pride,
     And Highland scab and hunger:
     If Providence has sent me here,
     ’Twas surely in his anger.
