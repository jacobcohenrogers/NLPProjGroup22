Verses To Collector Mitchell
     Friend of the Poet, tried and leal,
     Wha, wanting thee, might beg or steal;
     Alake, alake, the meikle deil
     Wi’ a’ his witches
     Are at it skelpin jig and reel,
     In my poor pouches?
     I modestly fu’ fain wad hint it,
     That One—pound—one, I sairly want it;
     If wi’ the hizzie down ye sent it,
     It would be kind;
     And while my heart wi’ life-blood dunted,
     I’d bear’t in mind.
     So may the Auld year gang out moanin’
     To see the New come laden, groanin’,
     Wi’ double plenty o’er the loanin’,
     To thee and thine:
     Domestic peace and comforts crownin’
     The hale design.
