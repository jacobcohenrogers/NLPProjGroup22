During my sophomore year, I applied for a prestigious writing internship. I poured everything into the application. When I didn’t get it, I pretended it didn’t matter. But the truth is, it stung—badly. I started questioning if I was really cut out for writing at all.

But that failure forced me to reckon with something deeper: was I writing for approval, or for expression? I began journaling again, not for anyone else but for me. I submitted to smaller publications. I read more, listened more, let myself grow without rushing. Looking back, that rejection was a redirection. Not away from writing, but toward a version of it that felt more honest.
