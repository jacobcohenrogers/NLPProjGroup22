Theniel Menzies’ Bonie Mary
     Air—“The Ruffian’s Rant,” or “Roy’s Wife.”
     In comin by the brig o’ Dye,
     At Darlet we a blink did tarry;
     As day was dawnin in the sky,
     We drank a health to bonie Mary.
     Chorus.—Theniel Menzies’ bonie Mary,
     Theniel Menzies’ bonie Mary,
     Charlie Grigor tint his plaidie,
     Kissin’ Theniel’s bonie Mary.
     Her een sae bright, her brow sae white,
     Her haffet locks as brown’s a berry;
     And aye they dimpl’t wi’ a smile,
     The rosy cheeks o’ bonie Mary.
     Theniel Menzies’ bonie Mary, &c.
     We lap a’ danc’d the lee-lang day,
     Till piper lads were wae and weary;
     But Charlie gat the spring to pay
     For kissin Theniel’s bonie Mary.
     Theniel Menzies’ bonie Mary, &c.
