O Can Ye Labour Lea?
     Chorus—O can ye labour lea, young man,
     O can ye labour lea?
     It fee nor bountith shall us twine
     Gin ye can labour lea.
     I fee’d a man at Michaelmas,
     Wi’ airle pennies three;
     But a’ the faut I had to him,
     He could na labour lea,
     O can ye labour lea, &c.
     O clappin’s gude in Febarwar,
     An’ kissin’s sweet in May;
     But my delight’s the ploughman lad,
     That weel can labour lea,
     O can ye labour lea, &c.
     O kissin is the key o’ luve,
     And clappin’ is the lock;
     An’ makin’ o’s the best thing yet,
     That e’er a young thing gat.
     O can ye labour lea, &c.
