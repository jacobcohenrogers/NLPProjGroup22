O Wert Thou In The Cauld Blast
     O wert thou in the cauld blast,
     On yonder lea, on yonder lea,
     My plaidie to the angry airt,
     I’d shelter thee, I’d shelter thee;
     Or did Misfortune’s bitter storms
     Around thee blaw, around thee blaw,
     Thy bield should be my bosom,
     To share it a’, to share it a’.
     Or were I in the wildest waste,
     Sae black and bare, sae black and bare,
     The desert were a Paradise,
     If thou wert there, if thou wert there;
     Or were I Monarch o’ the globe,
     Wi’ thee to reign, wi’ thee to reign,
     The brightest jewel in my Crown
     Wad be my Queen, wad be my Queen.
