I still remember the scent of fresh notebooks and coffee—two things I thought would somehow anchor me that first day. I had barely slept the night before, buzzing with that uncertain mixture of excitement and fear. As I walked across the quad, trying not to look as nervous as I felt, the campus felt impossibly big, every brick building whispering stories of people who belonged here more than I did. I clutched my bag too tight. I smiled too much.

But somewhere between the awkward introductions in English 101 and the quiet camaraderie of a shared table at lunch, something shifted. I found myself laughing—genuinely—at a joke someone made about Chaucer. There was this moment, brief and beautiful, when I realized that everyone else was just trying to find their footing too. That was the first time I felt like maybe I belonged. Not because I knew where I was going, but because I was finally okay with not knowing yet.
