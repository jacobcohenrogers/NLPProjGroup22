Lovely Polly Stewart
     Chorus.—O lovely Polly Stewart,
     O charming Polly Stewart,
     There’s ne’er a flower that blooms in May,
     That’s half so fair as thou art!
     The flower it blaws, it fades, it fa’s,
     And art can ne’er renew it;
     But worth and truth, eternal youth
     Will gie to Polly Stewart,
     O lovely Polly Stewart, &c.
     [Footnote 1: Bacon was the name of a presumably intrusive host.
     The lines are said to have “afforded much amusement.”—Lang]
     May he whase arms shall fauld thy charms
     Possess a leal and true heart!
     To him be given to ken the heaven
     He grasps in Polly Stewart!
     O lovely Polly Stewart, &c.
