The Henpecked Husband
     Curs’d be the man, the poorest wretch in life,
     The crouching vassal to a tyrant wife!
     Who has no will but by her high permission,
     Who has not sixpence but in her possession;
     Who must to he, his dear friend’s secrets tell,
     Who dreads a curtain lecture worse than hell.
     Were such the wife had fallen to my part,
     I’d break her spirit or I’d break her heart;
     I’d charm her with the magic of a switch,
     I’d kiss her maids, and kick the perverse bitch.
