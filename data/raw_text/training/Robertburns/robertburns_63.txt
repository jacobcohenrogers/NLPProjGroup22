Gude Ale Keeps The Heart Aboon
     Chorus—O gude ale comes and gude ale goes;
     Gude ale gars me sell my hose,
     Sell my hose, and pawn my shoon—
     Gude ale keeps my heart aboon!
     I had sax owsen in a pleugh,
     And they drew a’ weel eneugh:
     I sell’d them a’ just ane by ane—
     Gude ale keeps the heart aboon!
     O gude ale comes, &c.
     Gude ale hauds me bare and busy,
     Gars me moop wi’ the servant hizzie,
     Stand i’ the stool when I hae done—
     Gude ale keeps the heart aboon!
     O gude ale comes, &c.
