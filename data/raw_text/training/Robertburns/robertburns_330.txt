O Lay Thy Loof In Mine, Lass
     Chorus—O lay thy loof in mine, lass,
     In mine, lass, in mine, lass;
     And swear on thy white hand, lass,
     That thou wilt be my ain.
     A slave to Love’s unbounded sway,
     He aft has wrought me meikle wae;
     But now he is my deadly fae,
     Unless thou be my ain.
     O lay thy loof, &c.
     There’s mony a lass has broke my rest,
     That for a blink I hae lo’ed best;
     But thou art Queen within my breast,
     For ever to remain.
     O lay thy loof, &c.
