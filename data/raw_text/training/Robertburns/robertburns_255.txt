Postscript
     Ye’ve heard this while how I’ve been lickit,
     And by fell Death was nearly nickit;
     Grim loon! he got me by the fecket,
     And sair me sheuk;
     But by gude luck I lap a wicket,
     And turn’d a neuk.
     But by that health, I’ve got a share o’t,
     But by that life, I’m promis’d mair o’t,
     My hale and wee, I’ll tak a care o’t,
     A tentier way;
     Then farewell folly, hide and hair o’t,
     For ance and aye!
