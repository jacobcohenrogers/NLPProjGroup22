Clarinda, Mistress Of My Soul
     Clarinda, mistres of my soul,
     The measur’d time is run!
     The wretch beneath the dreary pole
     So marks his latest sun.
     To what dark cave of frozen night
     Shall poor Sylvander hie;
     Depriv’d of thee, his life and light,
     The sun of all his joy?
     We part—but by these precious drops,
     That fill thy lovely eyes,
     No other light shall guide my steps,
     Till thy bright beams arise!
     She, the fair sun of all her sex,
     Has blest my glorious day;
     And shall a glimmering planet fix
     My worship to its ray?
