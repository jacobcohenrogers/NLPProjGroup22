The Belles Of Mauchline
     In Mauchline there dwells six proper young belles,
     The pride of the place and its neighbourhood a’;
     Their carriage and dress, a stranger would guess,
     In Lon’on or Paris, they’d gotten it a’.
     Miss Miller is fine, Miss Markland’s divine,
     Miss Smith she has wit, and Miss Betty is braw:
     There’s beauty and fortune to get wi’ Miss Morton,
     But Armour’s the jewel for me o’ them a’.
