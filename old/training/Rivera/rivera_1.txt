My hero has always been my grandmother. She was the kind of person who made you feel like you were the most important person in the room—just by listening. She didn’t have a degree or a fancy job, but she had an inner compass that never wavered. She taught me how to make tamales, how to water plants gently, and how to face the world without fear but also without arrogance.

When I was younger, I didn’t understand why she would hum while doing dishes or pray for people who had hurt her. But as I’ve grown older, I see the kind of quiet strength that took. She taught me that heroism isn’t loud or showy. It’s being kind when it’s easier to be cold. It’s showing up, every single day, even when no one is watching.
