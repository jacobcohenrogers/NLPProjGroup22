Epitaph On My Own Friend And My Father’s Friend, Wm. Muir In Tarbolton Mill
     An honest man here lies at rest
     As e’er God with his image blest;
     The friend of man, the friend of truth,
     The friend of age, and guide of youth:
     Few hearts like his, with virtue warm’d,
     Few heads with knowledge so informed:
     If there’s another world, he lives in bliss;
     If there is none, he made the best of this.
