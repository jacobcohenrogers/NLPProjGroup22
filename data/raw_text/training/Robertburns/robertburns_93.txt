Scroggam, My Dearie
     There was a wife wonn’d in Cockpen, Scroggam;
     She brew’d gude ale for gentlemen;
     Sing auld Cowl lay ye down by me,
     Scroggam, my dearie, ruffum.
     The gudewife’s dochter fell in a fever, Scroggam;
     The priest o’ the parish he fell in anither;
     Sing auld Cowl lay ye down by me,
     Scroggam, my dearie, ruffum.
     They laid the twa i’ the bed thegither, Scroggam;
     That the heat o’ the tane might cool the tither;
     Sing auld Cowl, lay ye down by me,
     Scroggam, my dearie, ruffum.
