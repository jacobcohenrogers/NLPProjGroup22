A Grace Before Dinner, Extempore
     O thou who kindly dost provide
     For every creature’s want!
     We bless Thee, God of Nature wide,
     For all Thy goodness lent:
     And if it please Thee, Heavenly Guide,
     May never worse be sent;
     But, whether granted, or denied,
     Lord, bless us with content. Amen!
