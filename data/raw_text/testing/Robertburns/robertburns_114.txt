Versified Reply To An Invitation
     Sir,
     Yours this moment I unseal,
     And faith I’m gay and hearty!
     To tell the truth and shame the deil,
     I am as fou as Bartie:
     But Foorsday, sir, my promise leal,
     Expect me o’ your partie,
     If on a beastie I can speel,
     Or hurl in a cartie.
     Yours,
     Robert Burns.
     Mauchlin, Monday night, 10 o’clock.
