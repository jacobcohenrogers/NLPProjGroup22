Song—My Hoggie
     What will I do gin my Hoggie die?
     My joy, my pride, my Hoggie!
     My only beast, I had nae mae,
     And vow but I was vogie!
     The lee-lang night we watch’d the fauld,
     Me and my faithfu’ doggie;
     We heard nocht but the roaring linn,
     Amang the braes sae scroggie.
     But the houlet cry’d frau the castle wa’,
     The blitter frae the boggie;
     The tod reply’d upon the hill,
     I trembled for my Hoggie.
     When day did daw, and cocks did craw,
     The morning it was foggie;
     An unco tyke, lap o’er the dyke,
     And maist has kill’d my Hoggie!
