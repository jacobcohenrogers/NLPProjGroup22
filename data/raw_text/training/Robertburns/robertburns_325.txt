Highland Harry Back Again
     My Harry was a gallant gay,
     Fu’ stately strade he on the plain;
     But now he’s banish’d far away,
     I’ll never see him back again.
     Chorus.—O for him back again!
     O for him back again!
     I wad gie a’ Knockhaspie’s land
     For Highland Harry back again.
     When a’ the lave gae to their bed,
     I wander dowie up the glen;
     I set me down and greet my fill,
     And aye I wish him back again.
     O for him, &c.
     O were some villains hangit high,
     And ilka body had their ain!
     Then I might see the joyfu’ sight,
     My Highland Harry back again.
     O for him, &c.
