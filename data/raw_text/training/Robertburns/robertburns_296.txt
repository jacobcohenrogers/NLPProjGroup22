Dialogue song—Philly And Willy
     Tune—“The Sow’s tail to Geordie.”
          He. O Philly, happy be that day,
     When roving thro’ the gather’d hay,
     My youthfu’ heart was stown away,
     And by thy charms, my Philly.
          She. O Willy, aye I bless the grove
     Where first I own’d my maiden love,
     Whilst thou did pledge the Powers above,
     To be my ain dear Willy.
          Both. For a’ the joys that gowd can gie,
     I dinna care a single flie;
     The lad I love’s the lad for me,
     The lass I love’s the lass for me,
     And that’s my ain dear Willy.
     And that’s my ain dear Philly.
          He. As songsters of the early year,
     Are ilka day mair sweet to hear,
     So ilka day to me mair dear
     And charming is my Philly.
          She. As on the brier the budding rose,
     Still richer breathes and fairer blows,
     So in my tender bosom grows
     The love I bear my Willy.
          Both. For a’ the joys, &c.
          He. The milder sun and bluer sky
     That crown my harvest cares wi’ joy,
     Were ne’er sae welcome to my eye
     As is a sight o’ Philly.
          She. The little swallow’s wanton wing,
     Tho’ wafting o’er the flowery Spring,
     Did ne’er to me sic tidings bring,
     As meeting o’ my Willy.
     Both. For a’ the joys, &c.
          He. The bee that thro’ the sunny hour
     Sips nectar in the op’ning flower,
     Compar’d wi’ my delight is poor,
     Upon the lips o’ Philly.
          She. The woodbine in the dewy weet,
     When ev’ning shades in silence meet,
     Is nocht sae fragrant or sae sweet
     As is a kiss o’ Willy.
          Both. For a’ the joys, &c.
          He. Let fortune’s wheel at random rin,
     And fools may tine and knaves may win;
     My thoughts are a’ bound up in ane,
     And that’s my ain dear Philly.
          She. What’s a’ the joys that gowd can gie?
     I dinna care a single flie;
     The lad I love’s the lad for me,
     And that’s my ain dear Willy.
          Both. For a’ the joys, &c.
