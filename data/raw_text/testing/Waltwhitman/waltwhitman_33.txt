All this time, and at all times, wait the words of poems;
The greatness of sons is the exuding of the greatness of mothers and
        fathers;
The words of poems are the tuft and final applause of science.

Divine instinct, breadth of vision, the law of reason, health, rudeness of
        body, withdrawnness, gaiety, sun-tan, air-sweetness--such are some
        of the words of poems.
