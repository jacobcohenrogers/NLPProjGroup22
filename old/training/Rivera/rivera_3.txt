When I was younger, I thought success meant applause. Straight A’s. Awards. The kind of praise that echoes. But now, I think success is quieter. It’s waking up and feeling like you’re becoming more of who you’re meant to be. It’s having people in your life who really see you—and letting them in.

Success is finishing a book that took you weeks to get through. It’s writing something honest, even if no one reads it but you. It’s remembering to call your mom. It’s showing up, especially on the days you’d rather not. And maybe, more than anything, it’s still believing in yourself, even when things don’t go as planned.
