Raging Fortune—Fragment Of Song
     O raging Fortune’s withering blast
     Has laid my leaf full low, O!
     O raging Fortune’s withering blast
     Has laid my leaf full low, O!
     My stem was fair, my bud was green,
     My blossom sweet did blow, O!
     The dew fell fresh, the sun rose mild,
     And made my branches grow, O!
     But luckless Fortune’s northern storms
     Laid a’ my blossoms low, O!
     But luckless Fortune’s northern storms
     Laid a’ my blossoms low, O!
