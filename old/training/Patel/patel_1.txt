My hero is my grandmother. She never learned to write code or write emails, but she understood people with an intuition that rivaled any well-trained neural net. Widowed young, she raised four children while running a small tailoring business out of a one-room home. Her needle moved with quiet confidence, and so did she—stitching together a life that defied the limitations placed on her.

What makes her a hero to me isn’t just her resilience, but her ability to adapt. When smartphones arrived, she didn’t grumble. She asked questions. She made notes. She tried, failed, and tried again. There’s something deeply heroic about a person who keeps learning when the world doesn’t expect them to. In a way, she taught me that life’s most elegant solutions often come from persistent iteration, not instant success.
