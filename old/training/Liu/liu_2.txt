There was a semester in grad school where I was juggling work, classes, and caring for my mom while she recovered from surgery. I was exhausted. I remember writing a paper at 3 a.m. while microwaving soup for her, thinking, “How the heck am I going to make it through this?” But I did. Not perfectly, but I kept showing up. I leaned on friends, asked for extensions when I needed them, and reminded myself it was okay to not do it all.

Challenges don’t always come with big victories or dramatic endings. Sometimes it’s just getting through the week, one small win at a time. And those moments? They build resilience. So if you’re in the middle of something hard, don’t wait for it to look heroic. Just keep going. You’re doing better than you think.
