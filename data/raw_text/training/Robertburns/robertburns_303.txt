On The Birth Of A Posthumous Child
     Born in peculiar circumstances of family distress.
     Sweet flow’ret, pledge o’ meikle love,
     And ward o’ mony a prayer,
     What heart o’ stane wad thou na move,
     Sae helpless, sweet, and fair?
     November hirples o’er the lea,
     Chil, on thy lovely form:
     And gane, alas! the shelt’ring tree,
     Should shield thee frae the storm.
     [Footnote 1: It is a well-known fact that witches, or any evil
     spirits, have no power to follow a poor wight any further than
     the middle of the next running stream. It may be proper likewise
     to mention to the benighted traveller, that when he falls in with
     bogles, whatever danger may be in his going forward, there is
     much more hazard in turning back.—R.B.]
     May He who gives the rain to pour,
     And wings the blast to blaw,
     Protect thee frae the driving show’r,
     The bitter frost and snaw.
     May He, the friend o’ Woe and Want,
     Who heals life’s various stounds,
     Protect and guard the mother plant,
     And heal her cruel wounds.
     But late she flourish’d, rooted fast,
     Fair in the summer morn,
     Now feebly bends she in the blast,
     Unshelter’d and forlorn.
     Blest be thy bloom, thou lovely gem,
     Unscath’d by ruffian hand!
     And from thee many a parent stem
     Arise to deck our land!
