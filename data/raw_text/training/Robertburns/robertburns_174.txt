Of A’ The Airts The Wind Can Blaw^1
     Tune—“Miss Admiral Gordon’s Strathspey.”
     Of a’ the airts the wind can blaw,
     I dearly like the west,
     For there the bonie lassie lives,
     The lassie I lo’e best:
     [Footnote 1: Written during a separation from Mrs. Burns in their
     honeymoon. Burns was preparing a home at Ellisland; Mrs. Burns
     was at Mossgiel.—Lang.]
     There’s wild-woods grow, and rivers row,
     And mony a hill between:
     But day and night my fancys’ flight
     Is ever wi’ my Jean.
     I see her in the dewy flowers,
     I see her sweet and fair:
     I hear her in the tunefu’ birds,
     I hear her charm the air:
     There’s not a bonie flower that springs,
     By fountain, shaw, or green;
     There’s not a bonie bird that sings,
     But minds me o’ my Jean.
