Esteem For Chloris
     As, Chloris, since it may not be,
     That thou of love wilt hear;
     If from the lover thou maun flee,
     Yet let the friend be dear.
     Altho’ I love my Chloris mair
     Than ever tongue could tell;
     My passion I will ne’er declare—
     I’ll say, I wish thee well.
     Tho’ a’ my daily care thou art,
     And a’ my nightly dream,
     I’ll hide the struggle in my heart,
     And say it is esteem.
