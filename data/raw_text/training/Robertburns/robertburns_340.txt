Song—Green Grow The Rashes
     A Fragment
     Chor.—Green grow the rashes, O;
     Green grow the rashes, O;
     The sweetest hours that e’er I spend,
     Are spent amang the lasses, O.
     There’s nought but care on ev’ry han’,
     In ev’ry hour that passes, O:
     What signifies the life o’ man,
     An’ ’twere na for the lasses, O.
     Green grow, &c.
     The war’ly race may riches chase,
     An’ riches still may fly them, O;
     An’ tho’ at last they catch them fast,
     Their hearts can ne’er enjoy them, O.
     Green grow, &c.
     But gie me a cannie hour at e’en,
     My arms about my dearie, O;
     An’ war’ly cares, an’ war’ly men,
     May a’ gae tapsalteerie, O!
     Green grow, &c.
     For you sae douce, ye sneer at this;
     Ye’re nought but senseless asses, O:
     The wisest man the warl’ e’er saw,
     He dearly lov’d the lasses, O.
     Green grow, &c.
     Auld Nature swears, the lovely dears
     Her noblest work she classes, O:
     Her prentice han’ she try’d on man,
     An’ then she made the lasses, O.
     Green grow, &c.
