Address To The Toothache
     My curse upon your venom’d stang,
     That shoots my tortur’d gums alang,
     An’ thro’ my lug gies mony a twang,
     Wi’ gnawing vengeance,
     Tearing my nerves wi’ bitter pang,
     Like racking engines!
     When fevers burn, or argues freezes,
     Rheumatics gnaw, or colics squeezes,
     Our neibor’s sympathy can ease us,
     Wi’ pitying moan;
     But thee—thou hell o’ a’ diseases—
     Aye mocks our groan.
     Adown my beard the slavers trickle
     I throw the wee stools o’er the mickle,
     While round the fire the giglets keckle,
     To see me loup,
     While, raving mad, I wish a heckle
     Were in their doup!
     In a’ the numerous human dools,
     Ill hairsts, daft bargains, cutty stools,
     Or worthy frien’s rak’d i’ the mools,—
     Sad sight to see!
     The tricks o’ knaves, or fash o’fools,
     Thou bear’st the gree!
     Where’er that place be priests ca’ hell,
     Where a’ the tones o’ misery yell,
     An’ ranked plagues their numbers tell,
     In dreadfu’ raw,
     Thou, Toothache, surely bear’st the bell,
     Amang them a’!
     O thou grim, mischief-making chiel,
     That gars the notes o’ discord squeel,
     Till daft mankind aft dance a reel
     In gore, a shoe-thick,
     Gie a’ the faes o’ Scotland’s weal
     A townmond’s toothache!
