To Miss Ferrier
     Enclosing the Elegy on Sir J. H. Blair.
     Nae heathen name shall I prefix,
     Frae Pindus or Parnassus;
     Auld Reekie dings them a’ to sticks,
     For rhyme-inspiring lasses.
     Jove’s tunefu’ dochters three times three
     Made Homer deep their debtor;
     But, gien the body half an e’e,
     Nine Ferriers wad done better!
     Last day my mind was in a bog,
     Down George’s Street I stoited;
     A creeping cauld prosaic fog
     My very sense doited.
     Do what I dought to set her free,
     My saul lay in the mire;
     Ye turned a neuk—I saw your e’e—
     She took the wing like fire!
     The mournfu’ sang I here enclose,
     In gratitude I send you,
     And pray, in rhyme as weel as prose,
     A’ gude things may attend you!
