A few semesters ago, I had two students who didn’t get along during a group project—at all. It got tense, and at one point, I got a very long, very dramatic email. Instead of stepping in right away, I asked them both to meet with me together. I just said, “Let’s talk like humans.” We laid everything out—misunderstandings, expectations, and even personal stuff that had nothing to do with the project.

And you know what? They found common ground. Not best friends, but enough to finish the project and respect each other. That reminded me: most conflicts aren’t about who’s “right.” They’re about listening and being willing to see things from someone else’s side. That’s a skill worth practicing—not just in college, but in life.
