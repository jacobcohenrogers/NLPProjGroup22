Up In The Morning Early
     Cauld blaws the wind frae east to west,
     The drift is driving sairly;
     Sae loud and shill’s I hear the blast—
     I’m sure it’s winter fairly.
     Chorus.—Up in the morning’s no for me,
     Up in the morning early;
     When a’ the hills are covered wi’ snaw,
     I’m sure it’s winter fairly.
     The birds sit chittering in the thorn,
     A’ day they fare but sparely;
     And lang’s the night frae e’en to morn—
     I’m sure it’s winter fairly.
     Up in the morning’s, &c.
     How Long And Dreary Is The Night
     How long and dreary is the night,
     When I am frae my dearie!
     I sleepless lie frae e’en to morn,
     Tho’ I were ne’er so weary:
     I sleepless lie frae e’en to morn,
     Tho’ I were ne’er sae weary!
     When I think on the happy days
     I spent wi’ you my dearie:
     And now what lands between us lie,
     How can I be but eerie!
     And now what lands between us lie,
     How can I be but eerie!
     How slow ye move, ye heavy hours,
     As ye were wae and weary!
     It wasna sae ye glinted by,
     When I was wi’ my dearie!
     It wasna sae ye glinted by,
     When I was wi’ my dearie!
