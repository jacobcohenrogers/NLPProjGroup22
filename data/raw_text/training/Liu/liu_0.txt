I still remember my first day at college like it was yesterday—even though it absolutely wasn’t. I wore a collared shirt to make a good impression, and I ended up sweating through it because I got lost trying to find my class. I walked into a geology lab instead of my English comp class, and nobody corrected me for 20 minutes. Classic. But here’s the thing: everyone else felt just as uncertain and awkward. We were all just trying to figure it out together.

So if you're feeling nervous or out of place, you're in good company. That first day is less about getting it all right and more about showing up, asking questions, and giving yourself grace. College is a new chapter—not a pop quiz. You get to learn, make mistakes, and slowly build something you're proud of. You belong here, even if you don't quite feel it yet.
