Song—Phillis The Fair
     Tune—“Robin Adair.”
     While larks, with little wing,
     Fann’d the pure air,
     Tasting the breathing Spring,
     Forth I did fare:
     Gay the sun’s golden eye
     Peep’d o’er the mountains high;
     Such thy morn! did I cry,
     Phillis the fair.
     In each bird’s careless song,
     Glad I did share;
     While yon wild-flowers among,
     Chance led me there!
     Sweet to the op’ning day,
     Rosebuds bent the dewy spray;
     Such thy bloom! did I say,
     Phillis the fair.
     Down in a shady walk,
     Doves cooing were;
     I mark’d the cruel hawk
     Caught in a snare:
     So kind may fortune be,
     Such make his destiny,
     He who would injure thee,
     Phillis the fair.
