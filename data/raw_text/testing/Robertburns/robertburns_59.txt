Lines On Fergusson, The Poet
     Ill-fated genius! Heaven-taught Fergusson!
     What heart that feels and will not yield a tear,
     To think Life’s sun did set e’er well begun
     To shed its influence on thy bright career.
     O why should truest Worth and Genius pine
     Beneath the iron grasp of Want and Woe,
     While titled knaves and idiot—Greatness shine
     In all the splendour Fortune can bestow?
