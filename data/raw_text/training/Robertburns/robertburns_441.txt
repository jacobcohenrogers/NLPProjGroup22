Wandering Willie—First Version
     Here awa, there awa, wandering Willie,
     Now tired with wandering, haud awa hame;
     Come to my bosom, my ae only dearie,
     And tell me thou bring’st me my Willie the same.
     Loud blew the cauld winter winds at our parting;
     It was na the blast brought the tear in my e’e:
     Now welcome the Simmer, and welcome my Willie,
     The Simmer to Nature, my Willie to me.
     Ye hurricanes rest in the cave o’your slumbers,
     O how your wild horrors a lover alarms!
     Awaken ye breezes, row gently ye billows,
     And waft my dear laddie ance mair to my arms.
     But if he’s forgotten his faithfullest Nannie,
     O still flow between us, thou wide roaring main;
     May I never see it, may I never trow it,
     But, dying, believe that my Willie’s my ain!
