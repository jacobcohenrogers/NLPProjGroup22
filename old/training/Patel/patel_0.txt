The first day of college felt like booting up a new system—fresh, exciting, and just a bit unpredictable. I remember standing at the gates of the engineering campus with my backpack strapped on like a deployment package, full of pens, notebooks, and an optimistic heart. The courtyard buzzed with unfamiliar faces and scattered conversations. Orientation felt like a soft-launch, but my mind was already spinning with what lay ahead—algorithms, late-night debugging, and the silent joy of solving a problem after hours of work.

Later that day, I met my first real bug—not in code, but in confidence. During the icebreaker session, we were asked to stand up and share why we chose computer science. I froze. My voice faltered, and I ended up saying something generic about "liking logic." But even as I sat down embarrassed, I realized: if I could debug that hesitation and recompile my courage, I might just find my rhythm here. College, like code, doesn’t need to be perfect on the first run—it just needs to start.
