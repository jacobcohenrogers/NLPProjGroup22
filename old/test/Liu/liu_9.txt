I hope the future is kinder. Kinder to the planet, to each other, and to ourselves. I hope we keep learning—not just facts and skills, but how to be better humans. I hope you all get the chance to pursue work that feels meaningful, to love deeply, and to stay curious.

And selfishly? I hope I keep teaching students like you—people who challenge me, inspire me, and remind me why I do this in the first place. So whatever the future holds, let’s face it with open hearts, steady feet, and maybe a slice of pizza now and then.
