Epitaph For Mr. William Michie
     Schoolmaster of Cleish Parish, Fifeshire.
     Here lie Willie Michie’s banes;
     O Satan, when ye tak him,
     Gie him the schulin o’ your weans,
     For clever deils he’ll mak them!
     Boat song—Hey, Ca’ Thro’
     Up wi’ the carls o’ Dysart,
     And the lads o’ Buckhaven,
     And the kimmers o’ Largo,
     And the lasses o’ Leven.
     Chorus.—Hey, ca’ thro’, ca’ thro’,
     For we hae muckle ado.
     Hey, ca’ thro’, ca’ thro’,
     For we hae muckle ado;
     We hae tales to tell,
     An’ we hae sangs to sing;
     We hae pennies tae spend,
     An’ we hae pints to bring.
     Hey, ca’ thro’, &c.
     We’ll live a’ our days,
     And them that comes behin’,
     Let them do the like,
     An’ spend the gear they win.
     Hey, ca’ thro’, &c.
