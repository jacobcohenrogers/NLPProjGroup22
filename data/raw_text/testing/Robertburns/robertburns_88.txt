O That’s The Lassie O’ My Heart
     Tune—“Morag.”
     O wat ye wha that lo’es me
     And has my heart a-keeping?
     O sweet is she that lo’es me,
     As dews o’ summer weeping,
     In tears the rosebuds steeping!
     Chorus—O that’s the lassie o’ my heart,
     My lassie ever dearer;
     O she’s the queen o’ womankind,
     And ne’er a ane to peer her.
     If thou shalt meet a lassie,
     In grace and beauty charming,
     That e’en thy chosen lassie,
     Erewhile thy breast sae warming,
     Had ne’er sic powers alarming;
     O that’s the lassie, &c.
     If thou hadst heard her talking,
     And thy attention’s plighted,
     That ilka body talking,
     But her, by thee is slighted,
     And thou art all delighted;
     O that’s the lassie, &c.
     If thou hast met this Fair One,
     When frae her thou hast parted,
     If every other Fair One
     But her, thou hast deserted,
     And thou art broken-hearted,
     O that’s the lassie o’ my heart,
     My lassie ever dearer;
     O that’s the queen o’ womankind,
     And ne’er a ane to peer her.
