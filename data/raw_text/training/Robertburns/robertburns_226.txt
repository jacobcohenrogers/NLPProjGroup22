The Lover’s Morning Salute To His Mistress
     Tune—“Deil tak the wars.”
     Sleep’st thou, or wak’st thou, fairest creature?
     Rosy morn now lifts his eye,
     Numbering ilka bud which Nature
     Waters wi’ the tears o’ joy.
     Now, to the streaming fountain,
     Or up the heathy mountain,
     The hart, hind, and roe, freely, wildly-wanton stray;
     In twining hazel bowers,
     Its lay the linnet pours,
     The laverock to the sky
     Ascends, wi’ sangs o’ joy,
     While the sun and thou arise to bless the day.
     Phoebus gilding the brow of morning,
     Banishes ilk darksome shade,
     Nature, gladdening and adorning;
     Such to me my lovely maid.
     When frae my Chloris parted,
     Sad, cheerless, broken-hearted,
     The night’s gloomy shades, cloudy, dark, o’ercast my sky:
     But when she charms my sight,
     In pride of Beauty’s light—
     When thro’ my very heart
     Her burning glories dart;
     ’Tis then—’tis then I wake to life and joy!
