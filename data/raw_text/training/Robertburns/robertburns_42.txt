The Charming Month Of May
     Tune—“Daintie Davie.”
     It was the charming month of May,
     When all the flow’rs were fresh and gay.
     One morning, by the break of day,
     The youthful, charming Chloe—
     From peaceful slumber she arose,
     Girt on her mantle and her hose,
     And o’er the flow’ry mead she goes—
     The youthful, charming Chloe.
     Chorus.—Lovely was she by the dawn,
     Youthful Chloe, charming Chloe,
     Tripping o’er the pearly lawn,
     The youthful, charming Chloe.
     The feather’d people you might see
     Perch’d all around on every tree,
     In notes of sweetest melody
     They hail the charming Chloe;
     Till, painting gay the eastern skies,
     The glorious sun began to rise,
     Outrival’d by the radiant eyes
     Of youthful, charming Chloe.
     Lovely was she, &c.
