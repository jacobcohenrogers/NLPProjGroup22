O Bonie Was Yon Rosy Brier
     O bonie was yon rosy brier,
     That blooms sae far frae haunt o’ man;
     And bonie she, and ah, how dear!
     It shaded frae the e’enin sun.
     Yon rosebuds in the morning dew,
     How pure, amang the leaves sae green;
     But purer was the lover’s vow
     They witness’d in their shade yestreen.
     All in its rude and prickly bower,
     That crimson rose, how sweet and fair;
     But love is far a sweeter flower,
     Amid life’s thorny path o’ care.
     The pathless, wild and wimpling burn,
     Wi’ Chloris in my arms, be mine;
     And I the warld nor wish nor scorn,
     Its joys and griefs alike resign.
