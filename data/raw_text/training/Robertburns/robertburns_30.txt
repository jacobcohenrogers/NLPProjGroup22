Songâ€”Out Over The Forth
     Out over the Forth, I look to the North;
     But what is the north and its Highlands to me?
     The south nor the east gie ease to my breast,
     The far foreign land, or the wide rolling sea.
     But I look to the west when I gae to rest,
     That happy my dreams and my slumbers may be;
     For far in the west lives he I loe best,
     The man that is dear to my babie and me.
