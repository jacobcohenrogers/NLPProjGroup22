Song—Willie Brew’d A Peck O’ Maut^1
     O Willie brew’d a peck o’ maut,
     And Rob and Allen cam to see;
     Three blyther hearts, that lee-lang night,
     Ye wadna found in Christendie.
     Chorus.—We are na fou, we’re nae that fou,
     But just a drappie in our ee;
     The cock may craw, the day may daw
     And aye we’ll taste the barley bree.
     Here are we met, three merry boys,
     Three merry boys I trow are we;
     And mony a night we’ve merry been,
     And mony mae we hope to be!
     We are na fou, &c.
     It is the moon, I ken her horn,
     That’s blinkin’ in the lift sae hie;
     She shines sae bright to wyle us hame,
     But, by my sooth, she’ll wait a wee!
     We are na fou, &c.
     Wha first shall rise to gang awa,
     A cuckold, coward loun is he!
     Wha first beside his chair shall fa’,
     He is the King amang us three.
     We are na fou, &c.
