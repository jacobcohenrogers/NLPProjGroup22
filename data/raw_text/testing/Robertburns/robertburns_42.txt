Bannocks O’ Bear Meal
     Chorus—Bannocks o’ bear meal,
     Bannocks o’ barley,
     Here’s to the Highlandman’s
     Bannocks o’ barley!
     Wha, in a brulyie, will
     First cry a parley?
     Never the lads wi’ the
     Bannocks o’ barley,
     Bannocks o’ bear meal, &c.
     Wha, in his wae days,
     Were loyal to Charlie?
     Wha but the lads wi’ the
     Bannocks o’ barley!
     Bannocks o’ bear meal, &c.
