There Was A Bonie Lass
     There was a bonie lass, and a bonie, bonie lass,
     And she lo’ed her bonie laddie dear;
     Till War’s loud alarms tore her laddie frae her arms,
     Wi’ mony a sigh and tear.
     Over sea, over shore, where the cannons loudly roar,
     He still was a stranger to fear;
     And nocht could him quail, or his bosom assail,
     But the bonie lass he lo’ed sae dear.
