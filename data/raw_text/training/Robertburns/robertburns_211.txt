Beware O’ Bonie Ann
     Ye gallants bright, I rede you right,
     Beware o’ bonie Ann;
     Her comely face sae fu’ o’ grace,
     Your heart she will trepan:
     Her een sae bright, like stars by night,
     Her skin sae like the swan;
     Sae jimply lac’d her genty waist,
     That sweetly ye might span.
     Youth, Grace, and Love attendant move,
     And pleasure leads the van:
     In a’ their charms, and conquering arms,
     They wait on bonie Ann.
     The captive bands may chain the hands,
     But love enslaves the man:
     Ye gallants braw, I rede you a’,
     Beware o’ bonie Ann!
