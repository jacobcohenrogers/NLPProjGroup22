Gold dash of waves at the ferry-wharf--posh and ice in the river, half-
        frozen mud in the streets, a grey discouraged sky overhead, the
        short last daylight of Twelfth-month,
A hearse and stages--other vehicles give place--the funeral of an old
Broadway stage-driver, the cortege mostly drivers.

Steady the trot to the cemetery, duly rattles the death-bell, the gate is
        passed, the new-dug grave is halted at, the living alight, the
        hearse uncloses,
The coffin is passed out, lowered, and settled, the whip is laid on the
        coffin, the earth is swiftly shovelled in,
The mound above is flattened with the spades--silence,
A minute, no one moves or speaks--it is done,
He is decently put away--is there anything more?

He was a good fellow, free-mouthed, quick-tempered, not bad-looking, able
        to take his own part, witty, sensitive to a slight, ready with life
        or death for a friend, fond of women, gambled, ate hearty, drank
        hearty, had known what it was to be flush, grew low-spirited toward
        the last, sickened, was helped by a contribution, died, aged forty-
        one years--and that was his funeral.

Thumb extended, finger uplifted, apron, cape, gloves, strap, wet-weather
        clothes, whip carefully chosen, boss, spotter, starter, hostler,
        somebody loafing on you, you loafing on somebody, headway, man
        before and man behind, good day's work, bad day's work, pet stock,
        mean stock, first out, last out, turning-in at night;
To think that these are so much and so nigh to other drivers--and he there
        takes no interest in them!
