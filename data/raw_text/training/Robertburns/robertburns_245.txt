Verses To Clarinda
     Sent with a Pair of Wine-Glasses.
     Fair Empress of the Poet’s soul,
     And Queen of Poetesses;
     Clarinda, take this little boon,
     This humble pair of glasses:
     And fill them up with generous juice,
     As generous as your mind;
     And pledge them to the generous toast,
     “The whole of human kind!”
     “To those who love us!” second fill;
     But not to those whom we love;
     Lest we love those who love not us—
     A third—“To thee and me, Love!”
