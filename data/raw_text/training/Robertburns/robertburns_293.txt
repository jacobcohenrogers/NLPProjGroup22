The Bonie Lad That’s Far Awa
     O how can I be blythe and glad,
     Or how can I gang brisk and braw,
     When the bonie lad that I lo’e best
     Is o’er the hills and far awa!
     It’s no the frosty winter wind,
     It’s no the driving drift and snaw;
     But aye the tear comes in my e’e,
     To think on him that’s far awa.
     My father pat me frae his door,
     My friends they hae disown’d me a’;
     But I hae ane will tak my part,
     The bonie lad that’s far awa.
     A pair o’ glooves he bought to me,
     And silken snoods he gae me twa;
     And I will wear them for his sake,
     The bonie lad that’s far awa.
     O weary Winter soon will pass,
     And Spring will cleed the birken shaw;
     And my young babie will be born,
     And he’ll be hame that’s far awa.
