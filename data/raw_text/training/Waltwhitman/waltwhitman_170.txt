Slow-moving and black lines go ceaselessly over the earth,
Northerner goes carried, and Southerner goes carried, and they on the
        Atlantic side, and they on the Pacific, and they between, and all
        through the Mississippi country, and all over the earth.

The great masters and kosmos are well as they go--the heroes and good-doers
        are well,
The known leaders and inventors, and the rich owners and pious and
        distinguished, may be well,
But there is more account than that--there is strict account of all.

The interminable hordes of the ignorant and wicked are not nothing,
The barbarians of Africa and Asia are not nothing,
The common people of Europe are not nothing--the American aborigines are
        not nothing,
The infected in the immigrant hospital are not nothing--the murderer or
        mean person is not nothing,
The perpetual successions of shallow people are not nothing as they go,
The lowest prostitute is not nothing--the mocker of religion is not nothing
        as he goes.
