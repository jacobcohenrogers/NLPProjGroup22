Song—Lady Onlie, Honest Lucky
     Tune—“The Ruffian’s Rant.”
     A’ The lads o’ Thorniebank,
     When they gae to the shore o’ Bucky,
     They’ll step in an’ tak a pint
     Wi’ Lady Onlie, honest Lucky.
     Chorus.—Lady Onlie, honest Lucky,
     Brews gude ale at shore o’ Bucky;
     I wish her sale for her gude ale,
     The best on a’ the shore o’ Bucky.
     Her house sae bien, her curch sae clean
     I wat she is a daintie chuckie;
     And cheery blinks the ingle-gleed
     O’ Lady Onlie, honest Lucky!
     Lady Onlie, &c.
