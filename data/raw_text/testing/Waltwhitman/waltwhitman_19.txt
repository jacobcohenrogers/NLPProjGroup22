My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still:
My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will.
But the ship, the ship is anchored safe, its voyage closed and done:
From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won!
            Exult, O shores! and ring, O bells!
            But I, with silent tread,
            Walk the spot my Captain lies,
                Fallen cold and dead.
