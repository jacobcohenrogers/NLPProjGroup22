Nations, ten thousand years before these States, and many times ten
        thousand years before these States;
Garnered clusters of ages, that men and women like us grew up and travelled
        their course, and passed on;
What vast-built cities--what orderly republics--what pastoral tribes and
        nomads;
What histories, rulers, heroes, perhaps transcending all others;
What laws, customs, wealth, arts, traditions;
What sort of marriage--what costumes--what physiology and phrenology;
What of liberty and slavery among them--what they thought of death and the
        soul;
Who were witty and wise--who beautiful and poetic--who brutish and
        undeveloped;
Not a mark, not a record remains,--And yet all remains.
