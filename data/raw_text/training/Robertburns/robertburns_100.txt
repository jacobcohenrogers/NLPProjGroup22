A Health To Ane I Loe Dear
     Chorus—Here’s a health to ane I loe dear,
     Here’s a health to ane I loe dear;
     Thou art sweet as the smile when fond lovers meet,
     And soft as their parting tear—Jessy.
     Altho’ thou maun never be mine,
     Altho’ even hope is denied;
     ’Tis sweeter for thee despairing,
     Than ought in the world beside—Jessy.
     Here’s a health, &c.
     I mourn thro’ the gay, gaudy day,
     As hopeless I muse on thy charms;
     But welcome the dream o’ sweet slumber,
     For then I am lockt in thine arms—Jessy.
     Here’s a health, &c.
     I guess by the dear angel smile,
     I guess by the love-rolling e’e;
     But why urge the tender confession,
     ’Gainst Fortune’s fell, cruel decree?—Jessy.
     Here’s a health, &c.
