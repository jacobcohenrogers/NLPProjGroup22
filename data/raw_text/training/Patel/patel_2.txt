During my first year on the job, I was tasked with leading a small internal tools project. It was my first time driving a codebase instead of just riding along. About halfway through, the backend I’d built started falling apart under load testing—queries timing out, API endpoints choking under pressure. I wanted to curl into a merge conflict and disappear.

But I didn’t. Instead, I took a step back and treated the situation like a debugging session. I reviewed logs, traced user flows, and sat down with a senior engineer who walked me through indexing strategies and caching. We re-architected part of the system. It worked. More than the technical win, I remember the mental shift—from panic to process. That experience taught me that most challenges are just puzzles you haven’t understood yet.
