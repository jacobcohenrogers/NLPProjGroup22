Fragment,—Why, Why Tell The Lover
     Tune—“Caledonian Hunt’s delight.”
     Why, why tell thy lover
     Bliss he never must enjoy?
     Why, why undeceive him,
     And give all his hopes the lie?
     O why, while fancy, raptur’d slumbers,
     Chloris, Chloris all the theme,
     Why, why would’st thou, cruel—
     Wake thy lover from his dream?
