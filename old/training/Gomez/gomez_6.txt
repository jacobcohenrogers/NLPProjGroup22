Photography snuck into my life through the back door. I started with phone snapshots on hikes, mostly to remember where I’d been. But then I started noticing how light filtered through trees at golden hour or how street cats in Morocco always find the same patch of sun. Now I carry my camera like a second pair of eyes.

What I love most is how photography trains you to see. You start noticing everything—the curve of a stranger’s smile, the way rain gathers in a flower’s petals, the quiet choreography of daily life. When I’m behind the lens, I feel tethered to the world in a softer, more intentional way. It’s a kind of prayer, a way of saying, “Look. This matters.”
