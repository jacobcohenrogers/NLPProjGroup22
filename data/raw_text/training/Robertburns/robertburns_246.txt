I Reign In Jeanie’s Bosom
     Louis, what reck I by thee,
     Or Geordie on his ocean?
     Dyvor, beggar louns to me,
     I reign in Jeanie’s bosom!
     Let her crown my love her law,
     And in her breast enthrone me,
     Kings and nations—swith awa’!
     Reif randies, I disown ye!
     It Is Na, Jean, Thy Bonie Face
     It is na, Jean, thy bonie face,
     Nor shape that I admire;
     Altho’ thy beauty and thy grace
     Might weel awauk desire.
     Something, in ilka part o’ thee,
     To praise, to love, I find,
     But dear as is thy form to me,
     Still dearer is thy mind.
     Nae mair ungenerous wish I hae,
     Nor stronger in my breast,
     Than, if I canna make thee sae,
     At least to see thee blest.
     Content am I, if heaven shall give
     But happiness, to thee;
     And as wi’ thee I’d wish to live,
     For thee I’d bear to die.
