Had I The Wyte? She Bade Me
     Had I the wyte, had I the wyte,
     Had I the wyte? she bade me;
     She watch’d me by the hie-gate side,
     And up the loan she shaw’d me.
     And when I wadna venture in,
     A coward loon she ca’d me:
     Had Kirk an’ State been in the gate,
     I’d lighted when she bade me.
     Sae craftilie she took me ben,
     And bade me mak nae clatter;
     “For our ramgunshoch, glum gudeman
     Is o’er ayont the water.”
     Whae’er shall say I wanted grace,
     When I did kiss and dawte her,
     Let him be planted in my place,
     Syne say, I was the fautor.
     Could I for shame, could I for shame,
     Could I for shame refus’d her;
     And wadna manhood been to blame,
     Had I unkindly used her!
     He claw’d her wi’ the ripplin-kame,
     And blae and bluidy bruis’d her;
     When sic a husband was frae hame,
     What wife but wad excus’d her!
     I dighted aye her e’en sae blue,
     An’ bann’d the cruel randy,
     And weel I wat, her willin’ mou
     Was sweet as sugar-candie.
     At gloamin-shot, it was I wot,
     I lighted on the Monday;
     But I cam thro’ the Tyseday’s dew,
     To wanton Willie’s brandy.
