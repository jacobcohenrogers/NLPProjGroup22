The Young Highland Rover
     Tune—“Morag.”
     Loud blaw the frosty breezes,
     The snaws the mountains cover;
     Like winter on me seizes,
     Since my young Highland rover
     Far wanders nations over.
     Where’er he go, where’er he stray,
     May heaven be his warden;
     Return him safe to fair Strathspey,
     And bonie Castle-Gordon!
     The trees, now naked groaning,
     Shall soon wi’ leaves be hinging,
     The birdies dowie moaning,
     Shall a’ be blythely singing,
     And every flower be springing;
     Sae I’ll rejoice the lee-lang day,
     When by his mighty Warden
     My youth’s return’d to fair Strathspey,
     And bonie Castle-Gordon.
