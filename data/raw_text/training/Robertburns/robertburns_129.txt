Reply To An Announcement By J. Rankine On His Writing To The Poet,
That A Girl In That Part Of The Country Was With A Child To Him.
     I am a keeper of the law
     In some sma’ points, altho’ not a’;
     Some people tell me gin I fa’,
     Ae way or ither,
     The breaking of ae point, tho’ sma’,
     Breaks a’ thegither.
     I hae been in for’t ance or twice,
     And winna say o’er far for thrice;
     Yet never met wi’ that surprise
     That broke my rest;
     But now a rumour’s like to rise—
     A whaup’s i’ the nest!
