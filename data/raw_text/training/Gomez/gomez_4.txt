I once rode a bus across the Balkans in winter. The windows fogged up within minutes, so I had to press my forehead to the glass to glimpse the snowy fields outside. There was a woman beside me knitting a red scarf, and the soft clicking of her needles became the rhythm of the ride. At every stop, locals would board with bags full of bread or cheese wrapped in cloth, the scent mixing with diesel and damp wool.

What made the journey memorable wasn’t the destination—it was the stillness between places. The way people leaned into sleep, heads bumping against windows. The sound of radio static as we passed through mountain tunnels. I realized then how much beauty there is in waiting, in transit. We’re so often chasing arrivals, but sometimes, the best part is the gentle in-between.
