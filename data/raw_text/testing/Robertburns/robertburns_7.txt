The Lass O’ Ecclefechan
     Tune—“Jack o’ Latin.”
     Gat ye me, O gat ye me,
     O gat ye me wi’ naething?
     Rock an reel, and spinning wheel,
     A mickle quarter basin:
     Bye attour my Gutcher has
     A heich house and a laich ane,
     A’ forbye my bonie sel,
     The toss o’ Ecclefechan.
     O haud your tongue now, Lucky Lang,
     O haud your tongue and jauner
     I held the gate till you I met,
     Syne I began to wander:
     I tint my whistle and my sang,
     I tint my peace and pleasure;
     But your green graff, now Lucky Lang,
     Wad airt me to my treasure.
