Is reform needed? Is it through you?
The greater the reform needed, the greater the PERSONALITY you need to
        accomplish it.

You! do you not see how it would serve to have eyes, blood, complexion,
        clean and sweet?
Do you not see how it would serve to have such a Body and Soul that, when
        you enter the crowd, an atmosphere of desire and command enters
        with you, and every one is impressed with your personality?
