To Daunton Me
     The blude-red rose at Yule may blaw,
     The simmer lilies bloom in snaw,
     The frost may freeze the deepest sea;
     But an auld man shall never daunton me.
     Refrain.—To daunton me, to daunton me,
     And auld man shall never daunton me.
     To daunton me, and me sae young,
     Wi’ his fause heart and flatt’ring tongue,
     That is the thing you shall never see,
     For an auld man shall never daunton me.
     To daunton me, &c.
     For a’ his meal and a’ his maut,
     For a’ his fresh beef and his saut,
     For a’ his gold and white monie,
     And auld men shall never daunton me.
     To daunton me, &c.
     His gear may buy him kye and yowes,
     His gear may buy him glens and knowes;
     But me he shall not buy nor fee,
     For an auld man shall never daunton me.
     To daunton me, &c.
     He hirples twa fauld as he dow,
     Wi’ his teethless gab and his auld beld pow,
     And the rain rains down frae his red blear’d e’e;
     That auld man shall never daunton me.
     To daunton me, &c.
