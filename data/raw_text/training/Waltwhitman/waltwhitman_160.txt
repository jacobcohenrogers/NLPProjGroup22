To think that the rivers will flow, and the snow fall, and the fruits
        ripen, and act upon others as upon us now--yet not act upon us!
To think of all these wonders of city and country, and others taking great
        interest in them--and we taking--no interest in them!

To think how eager we are in building our houses!
To think others shall be just as eager, and we quite indifferent!
I see one building the house that serves him a few years, or seventy or
        eighty years at most,
I see one building the house that serves him longer than that.

Slow-moving and black lines creep over the whole earth--they never cease--
        they are the burial lines;
He that was President was buried, and he that is now President shall surely
        be buried.
