Song.—Anna, Thy Charms
     Anna, thy charms my bosom fire,
     And waste my soul with care;
     But ah! how bootless to admire,
     When fated to despair!
     Yet in thy presence, lovely Fair,
     To hope may be forgiven;
     For sure ’twere impious to despair
     So much in sight of heaven.
