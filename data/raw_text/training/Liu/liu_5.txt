I once failed a big interview—badly. I was underprepared, overconfident, and when they asked a question I didn’t know, I tried to wing it instead of admitting I wasn’t sure. The awkward silence still haunts me. But here’s what I learned: failure humbles you, and that’s not a bad thing. It also forces you to look at what really matters—and how you want to grow.

Now, when something doesn’t go my way, I ask, “What is this trying to teach me?” Because that bombed interview? It led me to reevaluate what kind of job I really wanted. And eventually, it brought me here—to teaching, where I found my lane. Sometimes failure is just a fork in the road that you didn’t see coming.
