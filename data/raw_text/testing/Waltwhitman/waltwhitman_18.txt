O Camerado close!
O you and me at last--and us two only.
O a word to clear one's path ahead endlessly!
O something ecstatic and undemonstrable! O music wild!
O now I triumph--and you shall also;
O hand in hand--O wholesome pleasure--O one more desirer and lover!
O to haste, firm holding--to haste, haste on, with me.

_AMERICAN FEUILLAGE._


AMERICA always!
Always our own feuillage!
Always Florida's green peninsula! Always the priceless delta of Louisiana!
Always the cotton-fields of Alabama and Texas!
Always California's golden hills and hollows--and the silver mountains of
New Mexico! Always soft-breathed Cuba!
Always the vast slope drained by the Southern Sea--inseparable with the
        slopes drained by the Eastern and Western Seas!
The area the eighty-third year of these States[1]--the three and a half
        millions of square miles;
The eighteen thousand miles of sea-coast and bay-coast on the main--the
        thirty thousand miles of river navigation,
The seven millions of distinct families, and the same number of dwellings--
Always these, and more, branching forth into numberless branches;
Always the free range and diversity! Always the continent of Democracy!
Always the prairies, pastures, forests, vast cities, travellers, Canada,
        the snows;
Always these compact lands--lands tied at the hips with the belt stringing
        the huge oval lakes;
Always the West, with strong native persons--the increasing density there--
        the habitans, friendly, threatening, ironical, scorning invaders;
All sights, South, North, East--all deeds, promiscuously done at all times,
All characters, movements, growths--a few noticed, myriads unnoticed.
Through Mannahatta's streets I walking, these things gathering.
On interior rivers, by night, in the glare of pine knots, steamboats
        wooding up:
Sunlight by day on the valley of the Susquehanna, and on the valleys of the
Potomac and Rappahannock, and the valleys of the Roanoke and Delaware;
In their northerly wilds beasts of prey haunting the Adirondacks the
        hills--or lapping the Saginaw waters to drink;

In a lonesome inlet, a sheldrake, lost from the flock, sitting on the
        water, rocking silently;
In farmers' barns, oxen in the stable, their harvest labour done--they rest
        standing--they are too tired;
Afar on arctic ice, the she-walrus lying drowsily, while her cubs play
        around;
The hawk sailing where men have not yet sailed--the farthest polar sea,
        ripply, crystalline, open, beyond the floes;
White drift spooning ahead, where the ship in the tempest dashes.
On solid land, what is done in cities, as the bells all strike midnight
        together;
In primitive woods, the sounds there also sounding--the howl of the wolf,
        the scream of the panther, and the hoarse bellow of the elk;
In winter beneath the hard blue ice of Moosehead Lake, in summer visible
        through the clear waters, the great trout swimming;
In lower latitudes, in warmer air, in the Carolinas, the large black
        buzzard floating slowly, high beyond the tree-tops,
Below, the red cedar, festooned with tylandria--the pines and cypresses,
        growing out of the white sand that spreads far and flat;
Rude boats descending the big Pedee--climbing plants, parasites, with
        coloured flowers and berries, enveloping huge trees,
The waving drapery on the live oak, trailing long and low, noiselessly
        waved by the wind;
The camp of Georgia waggoners, just after dark--the supper-fires, and the
        cooking and eating by whites and negroes,
Thirty or forty great waggons--the mules, cattle, horses, feeding from
        troughs,
The shadows, gleams, up under the leaves of the old sycamore-trees--the
        flames--also the black smoke from the pitch-pine, curling and
        rising;
Southern fishermen fishing--the sounds and inlets of North Carolina's
        coast--the shad-fishery and the herring-fishery--the large sweep-
        seines--the windlasses on shore worked by horses--the clearing,
        curing, and packing houses;
Deep in the forest, in piney woods, turpentine dropping from the incisions
        in the trees--There are the turpentine works,
There are the negroes at work, in good health--the ground in all directions
        is covered with pine straw.
--In Tennessee and Kentucky, slaves busy in the coalings, at the forge, by
        the furnace-blaze, or at the corn-shucking;
In Virginia, the planter's son returning after a long absence, joyfully
        welcomed and kissed by the aged mulatto nurse.
On rivers, boatmen safely moored at nightfall, in their boats, under
        shelter of high banks,
Some of the younger men dance to the sound of the banjo or fiddle--others
        sit on the gunwale, smoking and talking;
Late in the afternoon the mocking-bird, the American mimic, singing in the
Great Dismal Swamp-there are the greenish waters, the resinous odour, the
        plenteous moss, the cypress-tree, and the juniper-tree.
--Northward, young men of Mannahatta--the target company from an excursion
        returning home at evening--the musket-muzzles all bear bunches of
        flowers presented by women;
Children at play--or on his father's lap a young boy fallen asleep, (how
        his lips move! how he smiles in his sleep!)
The scout riding on horseback over the plains west of the Mississippi--he
        ascends a knoll and sweeps his eye around.
California life--the miner, bearded, dressed in his rude costume--the
        staunch California friendship--the sweet air--the graves one, in
        passing, meets, solitary, just aside the horse-path;
Down in Texas, the cotton-field, the negro-cabins--drivers driving mules or
        oxen before rude carts--cotton-bales piled on banks and wharves.
Encircling all, vast-darting, up and wide, the American Soul, with equal
        hemispheres--one Love, one Dilation or Pride.
--In arriere, the peace-talk with the Iroquois, the aborigines--the
        calumet, the pipe of good-will, arbitration, and endorsement,
The sachem blowing the smoke first toward the sun and then toward the
        earth,
The drama of the scalp-dance enacted with painted faces and guttural
        exclamations,
The setting-out of the war-party--the long and stealthy march,
The single-file--the swinging hatchets--the surprise and slaughter of
        enemies.
--All the acts, scenes, ways, persons, attitudes, of these States--
        reminiscences, all institutions,
All these States, compact--Every square mile of these States, without
        excepting a particle--you also--me also.
Me pleased, rambling in lanes and country fields, Paumanok's fields,
Me, observing the spiral flight of two little yellow butterflies, shuffling
        between each other, ascending high in the air;
The darting swallow, the destroyer of insects--the fall-traveller
        southward, but returning northward early in the spring;
The country boy at the close of the day, driving the herd of cows, and
        shouting to them as they loiter to browse by the roadside;
The city wharf--Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Charleston, New Orleans,
        San Francisco,
The departing ships, when the sailors heave at the capstan;
Evening--me in my room--the setting sun,
The setting summer sun shining in my open window, showing the swarm of
        flies, suspended, balancing in the air in the centre of the room,
        darting athwart, up and down, casting swift shadows in specks on
        the opposite wall, where the shine is.
The athletic American matron speaking in public to crowds of listeners;
Males, females, immigrants, combinations--the copiousness--the
        individuality of the States, each for itself--the money-makers;
Factories, machinery, the mechanical forces--the windlass, lever, pulley--
All certainties,
The certainty of space, increase, freedom, futurity;
In space, the sporades, the scattered islands, the stars--on the firm
        earth, the lands, my lands!
O lands! O all so dear to me--what you are (whatever it is), I become a
        part of that, whatever it is.
Southward there, I screaming, with wings slow-flapping, with the myriads of
        gulls wintering along the coasts of Florida--or in Louisiana, with
        pelicans breeding,
Otherways, there, atwixt the banks of the Arkansaw, the Rio Grande, the
        Nueces, the Brazos, the Tombigbee, the Red River, the Saskatchewan,
        or the Osage, I with the spring waters laughing and skipping and
        running;
Northward, on the sands, on some shallow bay of Paumanok, I, with parties
        of snowy herons wading in the wet to seek worms and aquatic plants;
Retreating, triumphantly twittering, the king-bird, from piercing the crow
        with its bill, for amusement--And I triumphantly twittering;
The migrating flock of wild geese alighting in autumn to refresh
        themselves--the body of the flock feed--the sentinels outside move
        around with erect heads watching, and are from time to time
        relieved by other sentinels--And I feeding and taking turns with
        the rest;
In Canadian forests, the moose, large as an ox, cornered by hunters, rising
        desperately on his hind-feet, and plunging with his fore-feet, the
        hoofs as sharp as knives--And I plunging at the hunters, cornered
        and desperate;
In the Mannahatta, streets, piers, shipping, store-houses, and the
        countless workmen working in the shops,
And I too of the Mannahatta, singing thereof--and no less in myself than
        the whole of the Mannahatta in itself,
Singing the song of These, my ever-united lands--my body no more inevitably
        united part to part, and made one identity, any more than my lands
        are inevitably united, and made ONE IDENTITY;
Nativities, climates, the grass of the great pastoral plains,
Cities, labours, death, animals, products, good and evil--these me,--
These affording, in all their particulars, endless feuillage to me and to
America, how can I do less than pass the clue of the union of them, to
        afford the like to you?
Whoever you are! how can I but offer you divine leaves, that you also be
        eligible as I am?
How can I but, as here, chanting, invite you for yourself to collect
bouquets of the incomparable feuillage of these States?

[Footnote 1: 1858-59.]



_THE PAST-PRESENT._


I was looking a long while for the history of the past for myself, and for
        these chants--and now I have found it.
It is not in those paged fables in the libraries, (them I neither accept
        nor reject;)
It is no more in the legends than in all else;
It is in the present--it is this earth to-day;
It is in Democracy--in this America--the Old World also;
It is the life of one man or one woman to-day, the average man of to-day;
It is languages, social customs, literatures, arts;
It is the broad show of artificial things, ships, machinery, politics,
        creeds, modern improvements, and the interchange of nations,
All for the average man of to-day.



_YEARS OF THE UNPERFORMED._


Years of the unperformed! your horizon rises--I see it part away for more
        august dramas;
I see not America only--I see not only Liberty's nation but other nations
        embattling;
I see tremendous entrances and exits--I see new combinations--I see the
        solidarity of races;
I see that force advancing with irresistible power on the world's stage;
Have the old forces played their parts? are the acts suitable to them
        closed?
I see Freedom, completely armed, and victorious, and very haughty, with Law
        by her side, both issuing forth against the idea of caste;
--What historic denouements are these we so rapidly approach?
I see men marching and countermarching by swift millions!
I see the frontiers and boundaries of the old aristocracies broken;
I see the landmarks of European kings removed;
I see this day the People beginning their landmarks, all others give way;
Never were such sharp questions asked as this day;
Never was average man, his soul, more energetic, more like a God.
Lo! how he urges and urges, leaving the masses no rest;
His daring foot is on land and sea everywhere--he colonises the Pacific,
        the archipelagoes;
With the steam-ship, the electric telegraph, the newspaper, the wholesale
        engines of war,
With these, and the world-spreading factories, he interlinks all geography,
        all lands;
--What whispers are these, O lands, running ahead of you, passing under the
seas?
Are all nations communing? is there going to be but one heart to the globe?
Is humanity forming _en masse_?--for lo! tyrants tremble, crowns grow dim;
The earth, restive, confronts a new era, perhaps a general divine war;
No one knows what will happen next--such portents fill the days and nights.
Years prophetical! the space ahead as I walk, as I vainly try to pierce it,
        is full of phantoms;
Unborn deeds, things soon to be, project their shapes around me;
This incredible rush and heat--this strange ecstatic fever of dreams, O
        years!
Your dreams, O years, how they penetrate through me! (I know not whether I
        sleep or wake!)
The performed America and Europe grow dim, retiring in shadow behind me,
The unperformed, more gigantic than ever, advance, advance upon me.



_FLUX._


Of these years I sing,
How they pass through convulsed pains, as through parturitions;
How America illustrates birth, gigantic youth, the promise, the sure
        fulfilment, despite of people--Illustrates evil as well as good;
How many hold despairingly yet to the models departed, caste, myths,
        obedience, compulsion, and to infidelity;
How few see the arrived models, the athletes, the States--or see freedom or
        spirituality--or hold any faith in results.
But I see the athletes--and I see the results glorious and inevitable--and
        they again leading to other results;
How the great cities appear--How the Democratic masses, turbulent, wilful,
        as I love them,
How the whirl, the contest, the wrestle of evil with good, the sounding and
        resounding, keep on and on;
How society waits unformed, and is between things ended and things begun;
How America is the continent of glories, and of the triumph of freedom, and
        of the Democracies, and of the fruits of society, and of all that
        is begun;
And how the States are complete in themselves--And how all triumphs and
        glories are complete in themselves, to lead onward,
And how these of mine, and of the States, will in their turn be convulsed,
        and serve other parturitions and transitions.
And how all people, sights, combinations, the Democratic masses, too,
        serve--and how every fact serves,
And how now, or at any time, each serves the exquisite transition of Death.
