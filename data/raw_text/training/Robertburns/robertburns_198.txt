Johnie Lad, Cock Up Your Beaver
     When first my brave Johnie lad came to this town,
     He had a blue bonnet that wanted the crown;
     But now he has gotten a hat and a feather,
     Hey, brave Johnie lad, cock up your beaver!
     Cock up your beaver, and cock it fu’ sprush,
     We’ll over the border, and gie them a brush;
     There’s somebody there we’ll teach better behaviour,
     Hey, brave Johnie lad, cock up your beaver!
