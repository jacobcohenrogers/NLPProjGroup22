This Is No My Ain Lassie
     Tune—“This is no my house.”
     Chorus—This is no my ain lassie,
     Fair tho, the lassie be;
     Weel ken I my ain lassie,
     Kind love is in her e’re.
     I see a form, I see a face,
     Ye weel may wi’ the fairest place;
     It wants, to me, the witching grace,
     The kind love that’s in her e’e.
     This is no my ain, &c.
     She’s bonie, blooming, straight, and tall,
     And lang has had my heart in thrall;
     And aye it charms my very saul,
     The kind love that’s in her e’e.
     This is no my ain, &c.
     A thief sae pawkie is my Jean,
     To steal a blink, by a’ unseen;
     But gleg as light are lover’s een,
     When kind love is in her e’e.
     This is no my ain, &c.
     It may escape the courtly sparks,
     It may escape the learned clerks;
     But well the watching lover marks
     The kind love that’s in her eye.
     This is no my ain, &c.
