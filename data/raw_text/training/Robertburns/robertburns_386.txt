Wilt Thou Be My Dearie?
     Tune—“The Sutor’s Dochter.”
     Wilt thou be my Dearie?
     When Sorrow wring thy gentle heart,
     O wilt thou let me cheer thee!
     By the treasure of my soul,
     That’s the love I bear thee:
     I swear and vow that only thou
     Shall ever be my Dearie!
     Only thou, I swear and vow,
     Shall ever be my Dearie!
     Lassie, say thou lo’es me;
     Or, if thou wilt na be my ain,
     O say na thou’lt refuse me!
     If it winna, canna be,
     Thou for thine may choose me,
     Let me, lassie, quickly die,
     Still trusting that thou lo’es me!
     Lassie, let me quickly die,
     Still trusting that thou lo’es me!
