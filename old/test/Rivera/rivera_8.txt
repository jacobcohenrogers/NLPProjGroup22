One summer, when I was about eight, my cousins and I built a makeshift fort out of old sheets and branches in my grandmother’s backyard. We called it “The Kingdom,” and for one glorious week, it was ours. We made rules, held “council meetings,” and ate popsicles like royal feasts.

I remember the way the light filtered through the sheets, turning everything golden. I remember the scratch of grass on my legs and the sound of our laughter echoing into dusk. That week taught me something about imagination—how it can transform the ordinary into the extraordinary. Even now, when life feels too serious, I try to remember the magic of that little kingdom.
