Epigram At Roslin Inn
     My blessings on ye, honest wife!
     I ne’er was here before;
     Ye’ve wealth o’ gear for spoon and knife—
     Heart could not wish for more.
     Heav’n keep you clear o’ sturt and strife,
     Till far ayont fourscore,
     And while I toddle on thro’ life,
     I’ll ne’er gae by your door!
