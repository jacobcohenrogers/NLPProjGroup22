A few years back, I took a solo road trip up the California coast. No GPS, just a paper map and an old playlist full of 90s jams. I camped under the redwoods, got lost in a small town that only had one gas station, and had the best fish tacos of my life in Monterey. That trip taught me something unexpected: how to enjoy my own company.

We don’t always need a packed itinerary or a bunch of selfies to mark a great journey. Sometimes the best ones are quiet and slow, full of small discoveries. So whether it’s across the country or just a new route home from school, notice what you’re seeing—and how it’s shaping you.
