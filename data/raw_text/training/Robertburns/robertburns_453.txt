How Lang And Dreary Is The Night
     How lang and dreary is the night
     When I am frae my Dearie;
     I restless lie frae e’en to morn
     Though I were ne’er sae weary.
     Chorus.—For oh, her lanely nights are lang!
     And oh, her dreams are eerie;
     And oh, her window’d heart is sair,
     That’s absent frae her Dearie!
     When I think on the lightsome days
     I spent wi’ thee, my Dearie;
     And now what seas between us roar,
     How can I be but eerie?
     For oh, &c.
     How slow ye move, ye heavy hours;
     The joyless day how dreary:
     It was na sae ye glinted by,
     When I was wi’ my Dearie!
     For oh, &c.
