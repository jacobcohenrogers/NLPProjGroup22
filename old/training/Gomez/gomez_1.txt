My abuela, Lourdes, is my quiet hero. She never learned to read fluently, but she can recite entire recipes from memory and navigate the chaos of a family kitchen with the grace of a conductor. Every morning, she wakes before the sun and brews café con leche in her tiny stove-top pot, humming boleros under her breath. There’s a kind of magic in how she can thread a needle in dim light or tell stories that make time slow down.

She taught me that strength isn’t always loud. It can be the way you endure, the way you show up with hands ready and heart open. When I was twelve and heartbroken over a failed spelling bee, she said, “Mija, you don’t need to know every word—you just need to use the right ones when it matters.” I think about that often when I write.
