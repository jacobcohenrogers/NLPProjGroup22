Epigram On Rough Roads
     I’m now arrived—thanks to the gods!—
     Thro’ pathways rough and muddy,
     A certain sign that makin roads
     Is no this people’s study:
     Altho’ Im not wi’ Scripture cram’d,
     I’m sure the Bible says
     That heedless sinners shall be damn’d,
     Unless they mend their ways.

      on the Feal or Faile, a tributary of the Ayr.]
