My best friend Clara and I once had a falling out over something small—a misread text, a forgotten plan, the kind of thing that festers when you’re both tired and trying too hard. We went weeks without talking, each convinced the other didn’t care. But one rainy afternoon, I passed the café where we used to go after class and saw her through the window, staring into a mug with that same pensive look I knew so well.

I went in. We didn’t say sorry right away. We just ordered chai and sat in silence until the awkwardness melted. Then, slowly, we unpacked the missteps. I learned how important it is to name things out loud before they harden into silence. Conflict resolution, I’ve found, isn’t about being right—it’s about being willing.
