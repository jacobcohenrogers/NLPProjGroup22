O western orb, sailing the heaven!
Now I know what you must have meant, as a month since we walked,
As we walked up and down in the dark blue so mystic,
As we walked in silence the transparent shadowy night,
As I saw you had something to tell, as you bent to me night after night,
As you drooped from the sky low down, as if to my side, while the other
        stars all looked on;
As we wandered together the solemn night, for something, I know not what,
        kept me from sleep;
As the night advanced, and I saw on the rim of the west, ere you went, how
        full you were of woe;
As I stood on the rising ground in the breeze, in the cool transparent
        night,
As I watched where you passed and was lost in the netherward  black of the
        night,
As my soul, in its trouble, dissatisfied, sank, as where you, sad orb,
Concluded, dropped in the night, and was gone.
