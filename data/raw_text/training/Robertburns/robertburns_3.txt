     In leaving the daughter of a lord,
     And kissin’ a collier lassie an’ a’!

     O never look down, my lassie, at a’,
     Thy lips are as sweet, and thy figure complete,
     As the finest dame in castle or ha’.
     Tho’ thou has nae silk, and holland sae sma’,
     Tho’ thou has nae silk, and holland sae sma’,
     Thy coat and thy sark are thy ain handiwark,
     And lady Jean was never sae braw.
