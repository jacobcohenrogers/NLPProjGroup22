Kirk and State Excisemen
     Ye men of wit and wealth, why all this sneering
     ’Gainst poor Excisemen? Give the cause a hearing:
     What are your Landlord’s rent-rolls? Taxing ledgers!
     What Premiers? What ev’n Monarchs? Mighty Gaugers!
     Nay, what are Priests? (those seeming godly wise-men,)
     What are they, pray, but Spiritual Excisemen!
