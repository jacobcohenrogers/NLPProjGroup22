For a long time, I thought success meant awards, publications, applause—the things that look good in frames or sound impressive at dinner parties. But lately, it’s taken on a quieter shape. It’s the feeling of standing on a remote hilltop in Patagonia, my fingers numb from wind but my lungs full of air so clean it almost hurt. It’s finishing a draft of a blog post and knowing I said something true, even if only five people read it.

Success, to me now, is being deeply present. It's holding eye contact during an honest conversation. It’s cooking arroz con pollo just like my mom, and hearing my little cousin say, “Tastes like hers.” It’s showing up for my friends. If I can live a life stitched together with those small, golden threads, I’ll feel like I’ve made it.
