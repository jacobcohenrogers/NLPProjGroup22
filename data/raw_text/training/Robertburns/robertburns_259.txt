Lines To John M’Murdo, Esq. Of Drumlanrig
     Sent with some of the Author’s Poems.
     O could I give thee India’s wealth,
     As I this trifle send;
     Because thy joy in both would be
     To share them with a friend.
     But golden sands did never grace
     The Heliconian stream;
     Then take what gold could never buy—
     An honest bard’s esteem.
