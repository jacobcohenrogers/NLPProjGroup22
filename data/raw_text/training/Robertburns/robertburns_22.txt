Charlie, He’s My Darling
     ’Twas on a Monday morning,
     Right early in the year,
     That Charlie came to our town,
     The young Chevalier.
     Chorus—An’ Charlie, he’s my darling,
     My darling, my darling,
     Charlie, he’s my darling,
     The young Chevalier.
     As he was walking up the street,
     The city for to view,
     O there he spied a bonie lass
     The window looking through,
     An’ Charlie, &c.
     Sae light’s he jumped up the stair,
     And tirl’d at the pin;
     And wha sae ready as hersel’
     To let the laddie in.
     An’ Charlie, &c.
     He set his Jenny on his knee,
     All in his Highland dress;
     For brawly weel he ken’d the way
     To please a bonie lass.
     An’ Charlie, &c.
     It’s up yon heathery mountain,
     An’ down yon scroggie glen,
     We daur na gang a milking,
     For Charlie and his men,
     An’ Charlie, &c.
