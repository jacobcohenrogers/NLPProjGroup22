Jockey’s Taen The Parting Kiss
     Air—“Bonie lass tak a man.”
     Jockey’s taen the parting kiss,
     O’er the mountains he is gane,
     And with him is a’ my bliss,
     Nought but griefs with me remain,
     Spare my Love, ye winds that blaw,
     Plashy sleets and beating rain!
     Spare my Love, thou feath’ry snaw,
     Drifting o’er the frozen plain!
     When the shades of evening creep
     O’er the day’s fair, gladsome e’e,
     Sound and safely may he sleep,
     Sweetly blythe his waukening be.
     He will think on her he loves,
     Fondly he’ll repeat her name;
     For where’er he distant roves,
     Jockey’s heart is still the same.
