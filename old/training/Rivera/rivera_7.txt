In my junior year, I had a falling out with my roommate—over something small, as most things are, but it grew into silence that filled the apartment like fog. We avoided each other, each convinced we were the one wronged. It wasn’t until I saw her crying one night, quietly, in the kitchen, that I realized how much we both had lost.

I made tea. I sat down. I said, “I miss us.” And she nodded. The conversation that followed wasn’t easy, but it was honest. We apologized. We laughed at how stubborn we both were. In the end, it wasn’t about winning the argument—it was about choosing each other over being right.
