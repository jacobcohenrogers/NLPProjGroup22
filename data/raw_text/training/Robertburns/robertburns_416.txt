The Lad They Ca’Jumpin John
     Her daddie forbad, her minnie forbad
     Forbidden she wadna be:
     She wadna trow’t the browst she brew’d,
     Wad taste sae bitterlie.
     Chorus.—The lang lad they ca’Jumpin John
     Beguil’d the bonie lassie,
     The lang lad they ca’Jumpin John
     Beguil’d the bonie lassie.
     A cow and a cauf, a yowe and a hauf,
     And thretty gude shillin’s and three;
     A vera gude tocher, a cotter-man’s dochter,
     The lass wi’ the bonie black e’e.
     The lang lad, &c.
