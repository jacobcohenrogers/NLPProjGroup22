Fragment—The Mauchline Lady
     Tune—“I had a horse, I had nae mair.”
     When first I came to Stewart Kyle,
     My mind it was na steady;
     Where’er I gaed, where’er I rade,
     A mistress still I had aye.
     But when I came roun’ by Mauchline toun,
     Not dreadin anybody,
     My heart was caught, before I thought,
     And by a Mauchline lady.
