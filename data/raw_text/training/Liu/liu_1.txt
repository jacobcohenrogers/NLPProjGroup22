One of my biggest heroes is my high school English teacher, Mr. Garcia. He had this incredible way of making every student feel like they mattered. He once told me, “You don’t have to be the loudest voice in the room to be heard—you just have to be honest.” That stuck. At a time when I was still figuring out who I was, he helped me believe my voice was worth sharing.

Heroes don’t have to wear capes or win awards. Sometimes they’re just people who listen, who see you, and who remind you that you’re capable of more than you think. So when I think about the kind of instructor I want to be, I think of Mr. Garcia—someone who made space for others to shine.
