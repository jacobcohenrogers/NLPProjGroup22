Whistle, And I’ll Come To You, My Lad
     Chorus.—O Whistle, an’ I’ll come to ye, my lad,
     O whistle, an’ I’ll come to ye, my lad,
     Tho’ father an’ mother an’ a’ should gae mad,
     O whistle, an’ I’ll come to ye, my lad.
     But warily tent when ye come to court me,
     And come nae unless the back-yett be a-jee;
     Syne up the back-stile, and let naebody see,
     And come as ye were na comin’ to me,
     And come as ye were na comin’ to me.
     O whistle an’ I’ll come, &c.
     At kirk, or at market, whene’er ye meet me,
     Gang by me as tho’ that ye car’d na a flie;
     But steal me a blink o’ your bonie black e’e,
     Yet look as ye were na lookin’ to me,
     Yet look as ye were na lookin’ to me.
     O whistle an’ I’ll come, &c.
     Aye vow and protest that ye care na for me,
     And whiles ye may lightly my beauty a-wee;
     But court na anither, tho’ jokin’ ye be,
     For fear that she wile your fancy frae me,
     For fear that she wile your fancy frae me.
     O whistle an’ I’ll come, &c.
