’Twas Na Her Bonie Blue E’e
     Tune—“Laddie, lie near me.”
     ’Twas na her bonie blue e’e was my ruin,
     Fair tho’ she be, that was ne’er my undoin’;
     ’Twas the dear smile when nae body did mind us,
     ’Twas the bewitching, sweet, stown glance o’ kindness:
     ’Twas the bewitching, sweet, stown glance o’ kindness.
     Sair do I fear that to hope is denied me,
     Sair do I fear that despair maun abide me,
     But tho’ fell fortune should fate us to sever,
     Queen shall she be in my bosom for ever:
     Queen shall she be in my bosom for ever.
     Chloris, I’m thine wi’ a passion sincerest,
     And thou hast plighted me love o’ the dearest!
     And thou’rt the angel that never can alter,
     Sooner the sun in his motion would falter:
     Sooner the sun in his motion would falter.
