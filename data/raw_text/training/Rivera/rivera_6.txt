I love to sketch. I’m not particularly good at it—not in a technical sense—but there’s something soothing about pencil on paper, about lines that don’t need to be perfect to mean something. I sketch when I’m overwhelmed, when I’m inspired, when I’m trying to make sense of a feeling.

Sometimes, it’s just shapes or shadows, the curve of a tree branch outside my window or the messy sprawl of my coffee cup. Other times, it’s faces I remember, moments I’m trying to hold onto. Drawing slows me down. It helps me see the world not just as it is, but as it might be if I paid a little more attention.
