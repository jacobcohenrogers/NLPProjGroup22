Song—Will Ye Go To The Indies, My Mary?
     Tune—“Will ye go to the Ewe-Bughts, Marion.”
     Will ye go to the Indies, my Mary,
     And leave auld Scotia’s shore?
     Will ye go to the Indies, my Mary,
     Across th’ Atlantic roar?
     O sweet grows the lime and the orange,
     And the apple on the pine;
     But a’ the charms o’ the Indies
     Can never equal thine.
     I hae sworn by the Heavens to my Mary,
     I hae sworn by the Heavens to be true;
     And sae may the Heavens forget me,
     When I forget my vow!
     O plight me your faith, my Mary,
     And plight me your lily-white hand;
     O plight me your faith, my Mary,
     Before I leave Scotia’s strand.
     We hae plighted our troth, my Mary,
     In mutual affection to join;
     And curst be the cause that shall part us!
     The hour and the moment o’ time!
