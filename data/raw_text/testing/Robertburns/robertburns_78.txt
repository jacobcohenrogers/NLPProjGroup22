Young Jockie Was The Blythest Lad
     Young Jockie was the blythest lad,
     In a’ our town or here awa;
     Fu’ blythe he whistled at the gaud,
     Fu’ lightly danc’d he in the ha’.
     He roos’d my een sae bonie blue,
     He roos’d my waist sae genty sma’;
     An’ aye my heart cam to my mou’,
     When ne’er a body heard or saw.
     My Jockie toils upon the plain,
     Thro’ wind and weet, thro’ frost and snaw:
     And o’er the lea I leuk fu’ fain,
     When Jockie’s owsen hameward ca’.
     An’ aye the night comes round again,
     When in his arms he taks me a’;
     An’ aye he vows he’ll be my ain,
     As lang’s he has a breath to draw.
