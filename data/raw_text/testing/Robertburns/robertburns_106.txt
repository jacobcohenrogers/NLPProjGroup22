Song—For A’ That^1
     Tune—“For a’ that.”
     Tho’ women’s minds, like winter winds,
     May shift, and turn, an’ a’ that,
     The noblest breast adores them maist—
     A consequence I draw that.
     Chorus
     For a’ that, an’ a’ that,
     And twice as meikle’s a’ that;
     The bonie lass that I loe best
     She’ll be my ain for a’ that.
     Great love I bear to a’ the fair,
     Their humble slave, an’ a’ that;
     But lordly will, I hold it still
     A mortal sin to thraw that.
     For a’ that, &c.
     But there is ane aboon the lave,
     Has wit, and sense, an’ a’ that;
     A bonie lass, I like her best,
     And wha a crime dare ca’ that?
     For a’ that, &c.
     In rapture sweet this hour we meet,
     Wi’ mutual love an’ a’ that,
     [Footnote 1: A later version of “I am a bard
      of no regard” in “The Jolly Beggars.”]
     But for how lang the flie may stang,
     Let inclination law that.
     For a’ that, &c.
     Their tricks an’ craft hae put me daft.
     They’ve taen me in, an’ a’ that;
     But clear your decks, and here’s—“The Sex!”
      I like the jads for a’ that.
     For a’ that, &c.
