O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells!
Rise up! for you the flag is flung, for you the bugle trills:
For you bouquets and ribboned wreaths; for you the shores a-crowding:
For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning.

            O Captain! dear father!
            This arm I push beneath you.
            It is some dream that on the deck
                You've fallen cold and dead!
