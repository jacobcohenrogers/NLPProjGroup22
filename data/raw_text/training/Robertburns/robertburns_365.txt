Come, Let Me Take Thee To My Breast
     Come, let me take thee to my breast,
     And pledge we ne’er shall sunder;
     And I shall spurn as vilest dust
     The world’s wealth and grandeur:
     And do I hear my Jeanie own
     That equal transports move her?
     I ask for dearest life alone,
     That I may live to love her.
     Thus, in my arms, wi’ a’ her charms,
     I clasp my countless treasure;
     I’ll seek nae main o’ Heav’n to share,
     Tha sic a moment’s pleasure:
     And by thy e’en sae bonie blue,
     I swear I’m thine for ever!
     And on thy lips I seal my vow,
     And break it shall I never.
