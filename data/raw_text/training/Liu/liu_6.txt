I’ve got a thing for making homemade pizza. Friday nights in my house are “Pizza Night,” and it’s the best ritual I’ve ever created. There’s something deeply satisfying about mixing the dough, letting it rise, and experimenting with toppings—yes, even pineapple sometimes. It’s a little messy, a little creative, and always worth it.

We all need something outside of work or school that makes us feel like ourselves again. Pizza-making does that for me. What’s your version of that? Whether it’s drawing, dancing, gaming, or gardening—make time for it. Your hobbies don’t need to make sense to anyone else. They just need to make you feel you.
