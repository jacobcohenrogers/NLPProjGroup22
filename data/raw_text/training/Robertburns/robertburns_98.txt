Fragment,—Damon And Sylvia
     Tune—“The Tither Morn.”
     Yon wandering rill that marks the hill,
     And glances o’er the brae, Sir,
     Slides by a bower, where mony a flower
     Sheds fragrance on the day, Sir;
     There Damon lay, with Sylvia gay,
     To love they thought no crime, Sir,
     The wild birds sang, the echoes rang,
     While Damon’s heart beat time, Sir.
