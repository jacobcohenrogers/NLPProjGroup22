The Cardin O’t, The Spinnin O’t
     I coft a stane o’ haslock woo’,
     To mak a wab to Johnie o’t;
     For Johnie is my only jo,
     I loe him best of onie yet.
     Chorus—The cardin’ o’t, the spinnin’ o’t,
     The warpin’ o’t, the winnin’ o’t;
     When ilka ell cost me a groat,
     The tailor staw the lynin’ o’t.
     For tho’ his locks be lyart grey,
     And tho’ his brow be beld aboon,
     Yet I hae seen him on a day,
     The pride of a’ the parishen.
     The cardin o’t, &c.
