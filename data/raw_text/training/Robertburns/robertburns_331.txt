Versified Note To Dr. Mackenzie, Mauchline
     Friday first’s the day appointed
     By the Right Worshipful anointed,
     To hold our grand procession;
     To get a blad o’ Johnie’s morals,
     And taste a swatch o’ Manson’s barrels
     I’ the way of our profession.
     The Master and the Brotherhood
     Would a’ be glad to see you;
     For me I would be mair than proud
     To share the mercies wi’ you.
     If Death, then, wi’ skaith, then,
     Some mortal heart is hechtin,
     Inform him, and storm him,
     That Saturday you’ll fecht him.
     Robert Burns.
