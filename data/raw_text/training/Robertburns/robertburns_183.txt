Poortith Cauld And Restless Love
     Tune—“Cauld Kail in Aberdeen.”
     O poortith cauld, and restless love,
     Ye wrack my peace between ye;
     Yet poortith a’ I could forgive,
     An ’twere na for my Jeanie.
     Chorus—O why should Fate sic pleasure have,
     Life’s dearest bands untwining?
     Or why sae sweet a flower as love
     Depend on Fortune’s shining?
     The warld’s wealth, when I think on,
     It’s pride and a’ the lave o’t;
     O fie on silly coward man,
     That he should be the slave o’t!
     O why, &c.
     Her e’en, sae bonie blue, betray
     How she repays my passion;
     But prudence is her o’erword aye,
     She talks o’ rank and fashion.
     O why, &c.
     O wha can prudence think upon,
     And sic a lassie by him?
     O wha can prudence think upon,
     And sae in love as I am?
     O why, &c.
     How blest the simple cotter’s fate!
     He woos his artless dearie;
     The silly bogles, wealth and state,
     Can never make him eerie,
     O why, &c.
