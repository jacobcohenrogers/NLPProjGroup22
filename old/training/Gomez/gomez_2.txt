I once got hopelessly lost in Kyoto. I’d wandered away from the tourist-friendly streets, enchanted by a quiet alley lined with tiny lanterns and the faint smell of sesame oil. Then my phone died. No maps, no translation app, no clue how to ask for help. Panic bloomed like a too-fast heartbeat, and I stood frozen in front of a shop selling handmade fans.

But then the shopkeeper, an elderly woman with silver hair in a bun, noticed my face and beckoned me inside. She poured me barley tea and pulled out a paper map from beneath the counter. We didn’t share a language, but she drew little symbols, pointed, mimed walking. When I stepped back outside, I wasn’t just oriented—I was grounded again. That moment reminded me that kindness is its own kind of compass, and sometimes, the challenge isn’t finding your way, but trusting someone to help you get there.
