The Laddie’s Dear Sel’
     There’s a youth in this city, it were a great pity
     That he from our lassies should wander awa’;
     For he’s bonie and braw, weel-favor’d witha’,
     An’ his hair has a natural buckle an’ a’.
     His coat is the hue o’ his bonnet sae blue,
     His fecket is white as the new-driven snaw;
     His hose they are blae, and his shoon like the slae,
     And his clear siller buckles, they dazzle us a’.
     For beauty and fortune the laddie’s been courtin;
     Weel-featur’d, weel-tocher’d, weel-mounted an’ braw;
     But chiefly the siller that gars him gang till her,
     The penny’s the jewel that beautifies a’.
     There’s Meg wi’ the mailen that fain wad a haen him,
     And Susie, wha’s daddie was laird o’ the Ha’;
     There’s lang-tocher’d Nancy maist fetters his fancy,
     —But the laddie’s dear sel’, he loes dearest of a’.
