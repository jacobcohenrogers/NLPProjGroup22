The Farewell
     The valiant, in himself, what can he suffer?
     Or what does he regard his single woes?
     But when, alas! he multiplies himself,
     To dearer serves, to the lov’d tender fair,
     To those whose bliss, whose beings hang upon him,
     To helpless children,—then, Oh then, he feels
     The point of misery festering in his heart,
     And weakly weeps his fortunes like a coward:
     Such, such am I!—undone!
