Song—Merry Hae I Been Teethin A Heckle
     Tune—“The bob O’ Dumblane.”
     O Merry hae I been teethin’ a heckle,
     An’ merry hae I been shapin’ a spoon;
     O merry hae I been cloutin’ a kettle,
     An’ kissin’ my Katie when a’ was done.
     O a’ the lang day I ca’ at my hammer,
     An’ a’ the lang day I whistle and sing;
     O a’ the lang night I cuddle my kimmer,
     An’ a’ the lang night as happy’s a king.
     Bitter in idol I lickit my winnins
     O’ marrying Bess, to gie her a slave:
     Blest be the hour she cool’d in her linnens,
     And blythe be the bird that sings on her grave!
     Come to my arms, my Katie, my Katie;
     O come to my arms and kiss me again!
     Drucken or sober, here’s to thee, Katie!
     An’ blest be the day I did it again.
