Blythe Hae I been On Yon Hill
     Tune—“The Quaker’s Wife.”
     Blythe hae I been on yon hill,
     As the lambs before me;
     Careless ilka thought and free,
     As the breeze flew o’er me;
     Now nae langer sport and play,
     Mirth or sang can please me;
     Lesley is sae fair and coy,
     Care and anguish seize me.
     Heavy, heavy is the task,
     Hopeless love declaring;
     Trembling, I dow nocht but glow’r,
     Sighing, dumb despairing!
     If she winna ease the thraws
     In my bosom swelling,
     Underneath the grass-green sod,
     Soon maun be my dwelling.
