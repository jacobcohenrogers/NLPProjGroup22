Carle, An The King Come
     Chorus.—Carle, an the King come,
     Carle, an the King come,
     Thou shalt dance and I will sing,
     Carle, an the King come.
     An somebody were come again,
     Then somebody maun cross the main,
     And every man shall hae his ain,
     Carle, an the King come.
     Carle, an the King come, &c.
     I trow we swapped for the worse,
     We gae the boot and better horse;
     And that we’ll tell them at the cross,
     Carle, an the King come.
     Carle, an the King come, &c.
     Coggie, an the King come,
     Coggie, an the King come,
     I’se be fou, and thou’se be toom
     Coggie, an the King come.
     Coggie, an the King come, &c.
