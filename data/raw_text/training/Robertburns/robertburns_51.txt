Delia, An Ode
“To the Editor of The Star.—Mr. Printer—If the productions of a simple
ploughman can merit a place in the same paper with Sylvester Otway, and
the other favourites of the Muses who illuminate the Star with the
lustre of genius, your insertion of the enclosed trifle will be
succeeded by future communications from—Yours, &c., R. Burns.
          Ellisland, near Dumfries, 18th May, 1789.”
     Fair the face of orient day,
     Fair the tints of op’ning rose;
     But fairer still my Delia dawns,
     More lovely far her beauty shows.
     Sweet the lark’s wild warbled lay,
     Sweet the tinkling rill to hear;
     But, Delia, more delightful still,
     Steal thine accents on mine ear.
     The flower-enamour’d busy bee
     The rosy banquet loves to sip;
     Sweet the streamlet’s limpid lapse
     To the sun-brown’d Arab’s lip.
     But, Delia, on thy balmy lips
     Let me, no vagrant insect, rove;
     O let me steal one liquid kiss,
     For Oh! my soul is parch’d with love.
