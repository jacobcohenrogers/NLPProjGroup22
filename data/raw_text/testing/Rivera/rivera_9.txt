I don’t know exactly where I’ll end up, and that used to scare me. But now, I find a kind of peace in that uncertainty. I hope for a life that’s rich in connection—friends who feel like family, conversations that linger. I hope to keep writing, to find words for the things people feel but don’t always know how to say.

I hope for love—not the movie kind, but the steady, weather-the-storms kind. I hope to travel more, to listen deeply, to keep learning. And most of all, I hope I never lose the curiosity that’s carried me this far. If I can keep growing, keep creating, and keep finding beauty in the ordinary, I think I’ll be okay.
