Crowdie Ever Mair
     O that I had ne’er been married,
     I wad never had nae care,
     Now I’ve gotten wife an’ weans,
     An’ they cry “Crowdie” evermair.
     Chorus—Ance crowdie, twice crowdie,
     Three times crowdie in a day
     Gin ye crowdie ony mair,
     Ye’ll crowdie a’ my meal away.
     Waefu’ Want and Hunger fley me,
     Glowrin’ by the hallan en’;
     Sair I fecht them at the door,
     But aye I’m eerie they come ben.
     Ance crowdie, &c.
