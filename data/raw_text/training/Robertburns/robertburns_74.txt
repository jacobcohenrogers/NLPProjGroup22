Meg O’ The Mill
     O ken ye what Meg o’ the Mill has gotten,
     An’ ken ye what Meg o’ the Mill has gotten?
     She gotten a coof wi’ a claut o’ siller,
     And broken the heart o’ the barley Miller.
     The Miller was strappin, the Miller was ruddy;
     A heart like a lord, and a hue like a lady;
     The laird was a widdifu’, bleerit knurl;
     She’s left the gude fellow, and taen the churl.
     The Miller he hecht her a heart leal and loving,
     The lair did address her wi’ matter mair moving,
     A fine pacing-horse wi’ a clear chained bridle,
     A whip by her side, and a bonie side-saddle.
     O wae on the siller, it is sae prevailin’,
     And wae on the love that is fixed on a mailen!
     A tocher’s nae word in a true lover’s parle,
     But gie me my love, and a fig for the warl’!
