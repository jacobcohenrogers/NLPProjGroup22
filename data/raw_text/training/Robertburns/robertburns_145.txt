Song—Wha Is That At My Bower-Door
     Tune—“Lass, an I come near thee.”
     “Wha is that at my bower-door?”
      “O wha is it but Findlay!”
      “Then gae your gate, ye’se nae be here:”
      “Indeed maun I,” quo’ Findlay;
     “What mak’ ye, sae like a thief?”
      “O come and see,” quo’ Findlay;
     “Before the morn ye’ll work mischief:”
      “Indeed will I,” quo’ Findlay.
     “Gif I rise and let you in”—
     “Let me in,” quo’ Findlay;
     “Ye’ll keep me waukin wi’ your din;”
      “Indeed will I,” quo’ Findlay;
     “In my bower if ye should stay”—
     “Let me stay,” quo’ Findlay;
     “I fear ye’ll bide till break o’ day;”
      “Indeed will I,” quo’ Findlay.
     “Here this night if ye remain”—
     “I’ll remain,” quo’ Findlay;
     “I dread ye’ll learn the gate again;”
      “Indeed will I,” quo’ Findlay.
     “What may pass within this bower”—
     “Let it pass,” quo’ Findlay;
     “Ye maun conceal till your last hour:”
      “Indeed will I,” quo’ Findlay.
