A Waukrife Minnie
     Whare are you gaun, my bonie lass,
     Whare are you gaun, my hinnie?
     She answered me right saucilie,
     “An errand for my minnie.”
     O whare live ye, my bonie lass,
     O whare live ye, my hinnie?
     “By yon burnside, gin ye maun ken,
     In a wee house wi’ my minnie.”
     But I foor up the glen at e’en.
     To see my bonie lassie;
     And lang before the grey morn cam,
     She was na hauf sae saucie.
     O weary fa’ the waukrife cock,
     And the foumart lay his crawin!
     He wauken’d the auld wife frae her sleep,
     A wee blink or the dawin.
     An angry wife I wat she raise,
     And o’er the bed she brocht her;
     And wi’ a meikle hazel rung
     She made her a weel-pay’d dochter.
     O fare thee weel, my bonie lass,
     O fare thee well, my hinnie!
     Thou art a gay an’ a bonnie lass,
     But thou has a waukrife minnie.
