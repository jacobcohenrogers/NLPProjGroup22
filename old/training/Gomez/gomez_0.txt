The morning air was sticky with late-summer humidity, and my cotton shirt clung uncomfortably to my back as I lugged a duffel bag across the lawn. I remember the scent of freshly mowed grass mixed with nerves and possibility. Everything about campus felt oversized—arched brick buildings, winding paths, voices tumbling from every direction. I found my dorm by accident, tripping over a curb while trying to read the map upside down.

Later, after my parents drove away with teary waves, I sat on the edge of my new twin bed and listened to the unfamiliar chorus outside: the roll of skateboard wheels, someone playing guitar off-key, laughter echoing through the hall. I felt both invisible and on display, like a tourist in my own life. But then my roommate offered to split a mango with me—we peeled it over a paper towel, juice sticky on our fingers, talking about music and books. And just like that, it started to feel less like a threshold and more like a beginning.
