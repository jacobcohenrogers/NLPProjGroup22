Masonic Song
     Tune—“Shawn-boy,” or “Over the water to Charlie.”
     Ye sons of old Killie, assembled by Willie,
     To follow the noble vocation;
     Your thrifty old mother has scarce such another
     To sit in that honoured station.
     I’ve little to say, but only to pray,
     As praying’s the ton of your fashion;
     A prayer from thee Muse you well may excuse
     ’Tis seldom her favourite passion.
     Ye powers who preside o’er the wind, and the tide,
     Who marked each element’s border;
     Who formed this frame with beneficent aim,
     Whose sovereign statute is order:—
     Within this dear mansion, may wayward Contention
     Or withered Envy ne’er enter;
     May secrecy round be the mystical bound,
     And brotherly Love be the centre!
