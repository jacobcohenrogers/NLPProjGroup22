Lady Mary Ann
     O lady Mary Ann looks o’er the Castle wa’,
     She saw three bonie boys playing at the ba’,
     The youngest he was the flower amang them a’,
     My bonie laddie’s young, but he’s growin’ yet.
     O father, O father, an ye think it fit,
     We’ll send him a year to the college yet,
     We’ll sew a green ribbon round about his hat,
     And that will let them ken he’s to marry yet.
     Lady Mary Ann was a flower in the dew,
     Sweet was its smell and bonie was its hue,
     And the longer it blossom’d the sweeter it grew,
     For the lily in the bud will be bonier yet.
     Young Charlie Cochran was the sprout of an aik,
     Bonie and bloomin’ and straught was its make,
     The sun took delight to shine for its sake,
     And it will be the brag o’ the forest yet.
     The simmer is gane when the leaves they were green,
     And the days are awa’ that we hae seen,
     But far better days I trust will come again;
     For my bonie laddie’s young, but he’s growin’ yet.
