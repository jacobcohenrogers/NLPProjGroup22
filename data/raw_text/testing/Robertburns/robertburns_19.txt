Does Haughty Gaul Invasion Threat?
     Tune—“Push about the Jorum.”
     Does haughty Gaul invasion threat?
     Then let the louns beware, Sir;
     There’s wooden walls upon our seas,
     And volunteers on shore, Sir:
     The Nith shall run to Corsincon,
     And Criffel sink in Solway,
     Ere we permit a Foreign Foe
     On British ground to rally!
     We’ll ne’er permit a Foreign Foe
     On British ground to rally!
     O let us not, like snarling curs,
     In wrangling be divided,
     Till, slap! come in an unco loun,
     And wi’ a rung decide it!
     Be Britain still to Britain true,
     Amang ourselves united;
     For never but by British hands
     Maun British wrangs be righted!
     No! never but by British hands
     Shall British wrangs be righted!
     The Kettle o’ the Kirk and State,
     Perhaps a clout may fail in’t;
     But deil a foreign tinkler loun
     Shall ever ca’a nail in’t.
     Our father’s blude the Kettle bought,
     And wha wad dare to spoil it;
     By Heav’ns! the sacrilegious dog
     Shall fuel be to boil it!
     By Heav’ns! the sacrilegious dog
     Shall fuel be to boil it!
     The wretch that would a tyrant own,
     And the wretch, his true-born brother,
     Who would set the Mob aboon the Throne,
     May they be damn’d together!
     Who will not sing “God save the King,”
      Shall hang as high’s the steeple;
     But while we sing “God save the King,”
      We’ll ne’er forget The People!
     But while we sing “God save the King,”
      We’ll ne’er forget The People!
