Impromptu On General Dumourier’s Desertion From The French Republican Army
     You’re welcome to Despots, Dumourier;
     You’re welcome to Despots, Dumourier:
     How does Dampiere do?
     Ay, and Bournonville too?
     Why did they not come along with you, Dumourier?
     I will fight France with you, Dumourier;
     I will fight France with you, Dumourier;
     I will fight France with you,
     I will take my chance with you;
     By my soul, I’ll dance with you, Dumourier.
     Then let us fight about, Dumourier;
     Then let us fight about, Dumourier;
     Then let us fight about,
     Till Freedom’s spark be out,
     Then we’ll be damn’d, no doubt, Dumourier.
