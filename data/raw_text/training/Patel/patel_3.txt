To me, success is less about reaching a milestone and more about the quiet satisfaction of moving with integrity. It's writing clean code even when no one will review it, or taking the time to explain something to a newer teammate, not because it’s in your ticket, but because it matters.

Success feels like alignment—when what you do, how you do it, and why you’re doing it all point in the same direction. I’ve had days where I hit every deadline and still felt hollow. And I’ve had days where a small breakthrough, like simplifying a function or mentoring an intern, brought a deeper, more lasting sense of pride. That’s the kind of success I aim for—measured not just in output, but in meaning.
