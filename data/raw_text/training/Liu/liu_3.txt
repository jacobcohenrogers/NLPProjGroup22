Success used to mean getting straight A’s and nailing every presentation. Now? It’s about growth. It’s about waking up each day and doing your best with what you’ve got. It’s showing up, trying, learning from your mistakes, and being kind to yourself along the way.

When a student tells me they passed a class they thought they’d fail, or they spoke up in a group when they usually stay quiet—that’s success. It’s not always flashy, but it’s real. So ask yourself: what does success look like for you, not just what you think it should be? That’s where the good stuff lives.
