Song—She’s Fair And Fause
     She’s fair and fause that causes my smart,
     I lo’ed her meikle and lang;
     She’s broken her vow, she’s broken my heart,
     And I may e’en gae hang.
     A coof cam in wi’ routh o’ gear,
     And I hae tint my dearest dear;
     But Woman is but warld’s gear,
     Sae let the bonie lass gang.
     Whae’er ye be that woman love,
     To this be never blind;
     Nae ferlie ’tis tho’ fickle she prove,
     A woman has’t by kind.
     O Woman lovely, Woman fair!
     An angel form’s faun to thy share,
     ’Twad been o’er meikle to gi’en thee mair—
     I mean an angel mind.
