There was a semester where I felt like I was unraveling. I had taken on too much—five classes, a part-time job, and a volunteer project that I loved but couldn’t keep up with. My sleep was shot. I was late on assignments. I stopped returning calls. I started doubting everything, especially myself.

It took one long conversation with my advisor—who didn’t fix everything, but helped me name what I was feeling—for me to see that asking for help wasn’t weakness. I dropped a class. I scaled back on work. I learned, slowly, that boundaries are brave. That rest is part of the process. And somehow, in giving myself permission to stumble, I found my way back to steady ground.
